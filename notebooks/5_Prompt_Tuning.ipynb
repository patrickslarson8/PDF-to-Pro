For Army forces, operational art seeks to ensure that commanders employ forces, material, and time\\neffectively to achieve objectives. It requires a broad vision, the ability to anticipate, a careful understanding\\nof means to ends, and an understanding of inherent risk. Always within the context of a higher echelon joint\\nplan or order, using operational art helps Army commanders and staffs understand, visualize, and describe\\noperations, as shown in figure 2-4 on page 39.\\nPlanning and Operational Art \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 39 \\nFigure 2-4. Operational art \\n2-48. Operational art helps commanders to determine when, where, and for what purpose to employ forces\\nand to determine the sequence of those forces in major operations and battles. It requires commanders and\\nstaffs to answer these questions:\\n• What conditions, when established, constitute the desired end state (ends)?\\n• How will the force achieve these desired conditions (ways)?\\n• What sequence of actions helps attain these conditions (ways)?\\n• What resources are required to accomplish that sequence of actions (means)?\\n• What is the chance of failure or unacceptable consequences in performing that sequence of actions\\n(risk)?\\n2-49. Both ADM (described in Chapter 4) and the MDMP (described in Chapter 5) are tools used by Army\\ncommanders and their staffs in the application of operational art. ADM supports operational art as a\\nmethodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe problems and\\napproaches to solving them. ADM is associated with conceptual planning that helps commanders and staffs\\nframe an OE, frame ill-defined problems, and develop an operational approach to resolve identified problems.\\nThe understanding gained by both the process and specific outputs of ADM inform the more detailed\\nplanning conducted during the MDMP.\\n2-50. A key output of ADM is an operational approach. It is a broad description of the mission, operational\\nconcepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish the mission. The operational approach provides the\\nframework for operations, serves as the basis for detailed planning, and facilitates unity of purpose across the\\nforce. Operational art never occurs in a vacuum.   \n",

A reserve  is that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from\\naction at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3 -90).\\n1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power —the total means of destructive\\nand disruptive force that a military unit/formation can apply against an enemy at a given time (JP 3 -0).\\nD\\nesignating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and\\npriorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times\\nduring an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success  at the time.\\n1-40. Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets necessary to accomplish the\\nmission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort\\nin an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the\\ncurrent tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when\\npositioning their reserve. While commanders can assign their reserve a wide variety of tasks, throu gh\\npl\\nanning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution\\nas the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit\\nhas support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5 -0). Priorities of\\nmovement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support tha t commanders may use to\\nweight the main effort.\\nANTICIPATE EVENTS \\n1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and\\ncoordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated\\nuncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature \\nof operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables\\nthe force to   \n",

Planners conduct a troop-to-task analysis to determine \\nthe type of units and capabilities needed to accomplish these tasks.\\n5-100. Planners proceed to initially array friendly forces on the sketch, starting with the forces executing the\\nessential task and planning backwards in time, continuing with those units executing supporting tasks and\\nreserve requirements. The initial array focu ses on generic ground maneuver units without regard to specific\\ntype or task organization, and then planners consider all appropriate intangible factors. Planners array ground\\nforces two levels below their echelon. For example, at division level, planners array generic battalions.\\nDuring this step, planners do not assign missions to specific units; they only consider which forces are\\nnecessary to accomplish their task.\\nChapter 5 \\n102 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n5-101. The initial array identifies the total number of units needed, including the reserve, and it identifies\\npossible methods of dealing with enemy forces and stability tasks. If the number of units arrayed is less than\\nthe number available, planners place additional units in a pool for use when they develop the initial concept\\nof operations. If the number of units arrayed exceeds the number available, and the difference cannot be\\ncompensated for with intangible factors, the staff determines whether the COA is f easible or not. Ways to\\nmake up shortfalls include requesting additional resources, accepting risk in that portion of the assigned area,\\nha\\nving units execute multiple tasks, or executing tasks required for the COA sequentially rather than\\nsimultaneously.\\nDevelop the Concept of Operations \\n5-102. Once forces are arrayed, the staff develops a concept of operations for each COA. The concept of\\noperations describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the mission within the commander ’s intent. I t\\nco\\nncisely expresses the “how” of the commander’s visualization and governs the design of supporting plans\\nor annexes. The concept of operations summarizes the contributions of all warfighting functions, ensures the\\nholistic application of combat power, and links together the various efforts of subordinate units into a\\ncohesive operation.\\n5-103.

The unit mission\\ns\\ntatement, along with the commander ’s intent, provide the primary focus for subordinate actions during\\nplanning, preparing, executing, and assessing. The commander either directs or receives and approves,\\nmodifies, or rejects the staff ’s proposed mission statement. Generally, the mission statement is approved\\nduring the mission analysis brief or shortly after the brief prior to moving forward in the process.\\n5-60. The who, where, and when  of a mission statement are straightforward. The what  and why are more\\nchallenging to write and can confuse subordinates if not stated clearly. The what of a mission statement is\\nalways a task and expressed in terms of action verbs. The task within a mission statement is not required to\\nbe a tactical mission task. It may be any task deemed essential to the mission. The why  puts the task into\\ncontext by describing the reason it is performed. The why  provides the mission’ s purpose—the reason the\\nunit is to perform the task and how it is intended to contribute to the higher echelon headquarters’ success. It\\nis integral to mission command and mission orders. With discussion and coordination from higher\\nheadquarters, subordinate commands may adjust the task, but not the purpose. The five elements of a mission\\nstatement answer these questions:\\nChapter 5 \\n92 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n• Who will execute the operation (unit or organization)?\\n• What is the unit’s essential task?\\n• When will the operation begin (by time or event) or what is the duration of the operation?\\n• Where will the operation occur (assigned areas, objective, or graphic control measure)?\\n• Why will the force conduct the operations (for what purpose)?\\nExample 1. 1-505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (who) seizes (what or task) AREA \\nNOTIONAL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (where) not later than D-day, H+3 (when) to allow \\nfollow-on forces to air-land into AO SPARTAN (why or purpose).  \\nExample 2.

Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. \\nTime, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The\\ncommander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum\\ntime for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of\\ntwo-thirds of available time for subordinate units to conduct their planning and preparation. This leaves\\none-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the\\nother two -thirds for their own preparation. Commanders should c onsider when an order is issued to\\nsubordinate units. For example, an order transmitted at 0300 to meet the one -third, two-thirds rule may not\\ngive subordinate units adequate time to effectively plan.\\n5-23. Commanders and staffs also consider their higher echelon headquarters ’ timeline, their operational\\ntimeline, their planning timeline, anticipated enemy timelines, light and weather, and other essential factors.\\nA useful technique to help the commander and staff visualize the relationships and synchronization between\\nthese timelines is to build a higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data  timeline (also\\nknown as a HOPE[W/L] timeline). Figure 5 -3 depicts a sample higher, operational, pla nning, enemy, and\\nweather and light data timeline.\\nThe Military Decision-Making Process \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 83 \\nFigure 5-3.

Based on the commander’s initial allocation of time, the COS or XO approves a detailed staff planning\\ntimeline that outlines how long the headquarters can spend on each step of the MDMP.

If the process can continue without making a particular assumption, the assumption is unnecessary and\\nnot used. So long as an assumption is both valid and necessary, leaders treat it as a fact. Leaders continually\\nseek to confirm or deny the validity of their assumptions. The confirmation or denial of an assumption ma y\\nr\\nequire the problem and plan to be reassessed.\\nOpinions \\n3-24. When gathering information, leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment\\nthat the leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result\\nof years of experience. Leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts,\\ninclude them as opinions, or reject them.\\nOrganizing Information \\n3-25. Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the\\nproblem or its solution. Leaders determine these requirements as they gather information. They coordinate\\nwith other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations\\nthat may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine. For an informal example, a squad\\nleader checks with the squad to the right to make sure the squads’ fields of fire overlap. For a formal example,\\na corps action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, leaders\\nalways coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present \\nit to the decision maker.\\nIDENTIFY THE PROBLEM \\n3-26. The next step in problem solving is recognizing and defining a problem. This step is crucial, as the\\nproblem may not be obvious. Therefore, leaders determine what the problem is by clearly defining its scope\\nArmy Problem Solving \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 51 \\nand limitations. Leaders should allow sufficient time and resources to clearly define the problem before \\nmoving on to other steps in the process. \\n3-27.

They provide advice on Army capabilities and resources, force and resource posturing, and \\nthe conduct of operations from a land perspective. In addition, the theater  army develops a \\ntheater support plan to the CCP. This plan includes methods to achieve security cooperation, \\ntraining and exercise programs, and ongoing Army activities within the theater, including \\nintelligence, air and missile defense, sustainment, and communications. (See FM 3-94 and \\nATP 3-93 for a detailed discussion of the roles, responsibilities, and organization of theater \\narmies.) \\nContingency Plans \\n2-31. A key aspect of combatant command planning is the development of contingency plans. A contingency\\nplan is a branch of a campaign plan that is planned based on hypothetical situations for designated threats,\\ncatastrophic events, and contingent missions outside of crisis conditions (JP 5- 0). Contingency plans are\\nbranches to global, regional, functional, and combatant campaign plans that address potential threats that put\\none or more national interests at risk in ways that warrant military operations. Contingency plans are built to\\naccount for the possibility that campaign activities could fail to prevent aggression, fail to preclude large\\nscale instability in a key state or region, or fail to adequately respond to a natural disaster. The UCP, CPG,\\nand JSCP assign CCDRs responsibilities for developing specific contingency plans. CCDRs also develop\\ncontingency plans to their CCPs based on theater estimates.\\n2-32. Contingency plans address an anticipated crisis, and they must be modified during execution to respond \\nto conditions at the time of execution. If an approved contingency plan exists that closely resembles the\\nemerging scenario, that plan can be refined or adapted as necessary and executed. Contingency plans are\\noften phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable\\nto the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termina tion criteria. They\\naddress military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n2-33.

The levels of warfare distinguish four broad overlapping activities: providing national direction and\\ncreating national strategy (national strategic), conducting continuous theater campaigning (theater strategic);\\nplanning and conducting campaigns and major operations (operational); or planning and executing\\noperations, battles, engagements, and actions (tactical). Different commanders act at more than one level of\\nwar, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates\\nt\\nheater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campai gn\\nde\\nsign and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without\\nfinite limits or boundaries. They do, however, c orrelate to specific activities and responsibilities. They help\\ncommanders visualize the relationships and actions required to link strategic objectives, military operations\\nat various echelons, and tactical actions. Among the levels of warfare, planning horizons, methods, and\\nproducts differ greatly. Without this context, tactical operations become disconnected from operational end\\nstates and strategic objectives. There are skills and practices related to strategic, theater strategic, operational,\\nand tactical level that differ from each other and are enhanced by specific training and education.\\nNATIONAL STRATEGIC LEVEL \\n2-5. The national strategic level of warfare is the level of warfare at which the U.S. government formulates\\npolicy goals and ways to achieve them by synchronizing action across government and unified action partners \\nand employing the instruments of national power (FM 3-0).

Success during operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgement to\\navailable information and knowledge. As such, commanders and staffs seek to build and maintain situational\\nunderstanding throughout the operations process. Situational understanding is product of applying analysis\\nand judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission\\nvariables.\\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\nA-2. An operational environment (OE) is the aggregate of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that\\naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. For Army forces, an OE\\nincludes portions of the land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains understood through three\\ndimensions (human, information, and physical). The land, maritime, air, and space domains are defined by\\nt\\nheir physical areas. The cyberspace domain, a man -made network of networks, transits and connects  the\\not\\nher domains through the electromagnetic spectrum. (See FM 3-0 for a more detailed discussion of an OE.)\\nA-3. Understanding an OE forms the basis for decision making during planning, preparation, execution, and\\nassessment of an operation.

When problems are difficult to identify, the operation’s end state is unclear, or a course of action (COA)\\nis not self-evident, commanders employ ADM. This is often the case when developing long- range plans for\\nextended operations. ADM is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them. ADM is particularly useful as an aid to\\nconceptual planning, but it must be integrated with the detailed planning typically associated with the MDMP\\nto produce executable plans and orders. ADM may be conducted before, concurrent with, or after the MDMP. \\nThere is no one way or prescribed set of steps to employ the ADM. There are, however, several activities\\nassociated with ADM including—\\n• Framing an OE.\\n• Framing problems.\\n• Developing an operational approach.\\n• Reframing (as required).\\n1-55. While planners complete some activities before others, the understanding and learning within one\\nactivity may require revisiting the learning from another activity. Based on their understanding and learning\\ngained during ADM, commanders issue planning guidance—including an operational approach—to guide\\nmore detailed planning using the MDMP.

Integrated planning \\n1-51. The commander personally leads the conceptual component of planning. While commanders are\\nengaged in parts of detailed planning, they leave most specifics to staff officers. Conceptual planning\\nprovides the basis for subsequent planning. The commander’ s intent and operational approach provide the\\nframework for the entire plan. This framework leads to a concept of operations and associated schemes of\\nsupport, such as schemes of maneuver, intelligence, fires, protection, engineer operations, information, and\\ns\\nustainment. In turn, the schemes of support lead to the specifics of execution, including tasks to subordinate\\nunits and attachments (including annexes, appendices, tabs, and exhibits) to the base OPLAN or OPORD.\\nHowever, this dynamic does not operate in only one direction. Conceptual planning must respond to detailed\\nconstraints. For example, the realities of a deployment schedule (a detailed concern) influence the operational \\napproach (a conceptual concern).\\n1-52. Planning requires the integration of both conceptual thinking and detailed analysis. Army leaders\\nemploy several methodologies for planning, determining the appropriate mix based on the scope and\\nunderstanding of the problem, time available, and availability of a staff. Army planning methodologies\\ninclude—\\n• Army problem solving.\\n• Army design methodology (ADM).\\n• The military decision-making process (MDMP).\\n• Rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP).\\n• Troop leading procedures (TLP).\\nARMY PROBLEM SOLVING \\n1-53. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for Army leaders. Army\\nproblem solving forms the base logic of other planning methodologies. Where other methodologies are\\ndesigned for planning operations, Army problem solving is a methodology available for leaders to use to\\ni\\ndentify and solve a variety of problems both in garrison and in operations. Army problem solving is an\\nanalytical approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the\\nbest solution, developing a plan, and implementing that plan to solve the problem.

A planning team normally consists of a lead planner from the G -5, G-3, or \\nS-3 sections and representatives from each warfighting function. Additional staff members by area of\\nexpertise, liaison officers, and unified action partners are added to the team as required. When trying to plan\\ncollaboratively, those organizations or subordinate units must be notified to ensure the right personnel are\\nidentified to support the planning effort. Typically, for new missions or large planning efforts, the planning\\nteam may consist of representatives from all staff sections and unit liaison officers.

They consider\\nrelationships among specified, implied, and essential tasks and available assets. Staff officers use th e\\nc\\napabilities and resources recorded in their running estima tes as a starting point for their analysis. From this\\nanalysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all\\ntasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commander s a rough\\nc\\nomparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may\\nrequest from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success.\\nStaffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commander s to\\nunde\\nrstand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets\\nand relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\nDetermine Constraints \\n5-40. The commander and staff identify any constraints placed on their command. A constraint  is a\\nrestriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus\\nrestricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the\\nOPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example,\\nmay contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs,\\nor in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a\\nstarting point to their analysis.\\n5-41. Constraints could also be based on resource limitations in the command, information release\\nrestrictions, or legal constraints. Resource limitations may include the number of capabilities provided or the\\navailability of collection capabilities to support a n operation. The staff judge advocate provides review of\\nlegal constraints. The constraints may include rules of engagement or authorities in the OPLAN, OPORD, or\\nrelated documents.\\nIdentify Facts and Develop Assumptions \\n5-42.

Both types of joint plans have four levels of details: commander ’s estimate, base plan, co ncept\\nplan, and OPLAN.\\nD-4. An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of\\noperations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time -phased force and deployment list (JP 5- 0). An\\nOPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be\\ndeveloped for a single part or phase of a long- term operation. An OPLAN becomes an operation order\\n(OPORD) when the commander sets an execution time or designates an event that triggers the operation.\\nD-5. A supporting plan is an operation plan prepared by a supporting commander, a subordinate\\ncommander, or an agency to satisfy the requests or requirements of the supported commander’s plan (JP 5-0).\\nF\\nor example, an ARFOR commander develops a supporting plan for how Army forces will support the joint\\nforce commander’s campaign plan or OPLAN.\\nAppendix D \\n198 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nD-6. A branch is the contingency options built into the base plan. A branch is used for changing the mission,\\norientation, or direction of movement of a force to aid success of the operation based on anticipated events,\\nopportunities, or disruptions caused by enemy actions and reactions. Branches add flexibility to plans by\\nanticipating situations that could alter the basic plan or order.\\nD-7. A sequel is the subsequent major operation or phase based on the possible outcomes of the current\\nmajor operation or phase. For every action or major operation that does not accomplish a strategic or\\noperational objective, there should be a sequel for each possible outcome, such as win, lose, draw, or decisive\\nwin.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS \\nD-8.

It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in\\na\\ndvance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and third-\\norder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and\\nthreats.\\nChapter 1 \\n8 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n1-44. Planning keeps the force oriented on future objectives despite the requirements of current operations.\\nPlanning is essential for seizing and retaining the initiative by allowing commanders and staffs to consider\\npotential decisions and actions in advance. Planning reduces the time between decisions and actions during\\nexecution, especially at higher echelons. While some actions are implemented immediately, others require\\nforethought and preparation. For example, changing the direction of attack may be a relatively simple and\\nimmediate matter for a battalion; however, changing the scheme of maneuver for a division, including all its\\nsupport, is complicated and time consuming. Changing the priority of fires at division level may take\\nconsiderable time if artillery units must reposition. If leaders wait until an event occurs to begin planning and\\npreparing for a response, units may not be able to react quickly enough, ceding the initiative to enemy forces.\\n1-45. During execution planners continue to develop or refine options for potential enemy action and friendly \\nopportunities. By anticipating potential events and transitions beforehand, planning promotes flexibility a nd\\nr\\napid decision making during execution. As  a result, the force anticipates events and acts purposefully and\\neffectively before the enemy can act or before situations deteriorate. Several tools are available to the\\ncommander and planners to assist in adapting to changing circumstances. These tools include —\\n• Decision points.\\n• Branches.\\n• Sequels.\\n1-46. A decision point is a point in space and the latest time when the commander or staff anticipates making\\na key decision concerning a specific course of action ( JP 5-0). A decision point is associated to actions by\\nthe enemy, the friendly force, or the population, and it is tied to a commander ’s critical information\\nrequirement (CCIR). Examples of friendly actions associated with a decision point range from a single tas k\\nt\\no a subordinate unit to the force as a whole in executing a branch or sequel.

While an operational approach is broad, it describes the commander’s visualization in time, space, and\\npurpose. It also addresses resources required to support the operational approach and accounts for risk. After\\nforming a framework for the operational approach using lines of operations and lines of effort, commanders\\nand planning teams consider additional elements of operational art to refine the operational approach.\\nAdditional elements of operational art to consider include—\\n• Operational reach, basing, and culmination.\\n• Tempo.\\n• Phasing and transitions.\\n• Risk.\\nOperational Reach, Basing, and Culmination \\n4-81. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ its\\ncapabilities. The skillful positioning of forces, reserves, bases, and equipment extend operational reach.\\nAlthough reach might be constrained or limited by the geography, enemy forces, and adversaries in and\\naround an operational area, reach is extended by—\\n• Forward positioning of capabilities and resources.\\n• Increasing the range and effectiveness of weapons systems.\\n• Leveraging host-nation support and contract support.\\n4-82. Basing, in the broadest sense, is an indispensable part of operational art. It is tied to lines of operations,\\nand it affects operational reach. In particular, the arrangement and positioning of bases in an operational area\\nunderwrites the ability of the force to protect its components from enemy action while expanding the distance \\nand duration of its capabilities. Commanders consider bases and base camps as intermediate staging bases,\\nlodgments (subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases as\\npart of the operational approach.\\n4-83. Commanders consider culmination when developing their operational approach and visualizi ng\\nr\\nesources to support it. Culmination is that point in time and space at which a force no longer possesses the\\ncapability to continue its current form of operations. Culmination means a shift in relative combat power. It\\nis relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare.

Assessment information requirements compete with other information\\nrequirements for resources. When an information requirement is not resourced, staffs cannot collect the\\nassociated indicator and must remove it from the plan. Staffs then adjust the assessment framework to ensure\\nthat the MOE or MOP is properly worded.\\nSTEP 5 - ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS AND GENERATING\\nRECOMMENDATIONS \\n8-31.  In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, commanders assign staff members to analyze\\nassessment data and develop recommendations. For example, the intelligence officer leads the assessment of\\nenemy forces. The engineer officer leads the effort on assessing infrastructure and development. The civil\\naffairs operations officer leads assessment concerning the progress of local and provincial governments. The\\nchief of staff (COS ) aggressively requires staff principals and subject matter experts to participate in\\nprocessing the formal assessment and in generating smart, actionable recommendations. The operations\\nresearch and analysis officer assists the commander and staff with developing both assessment frameworks\\nand the command’s assessment process.\\nSTEP 6 - IDENTIFY FEEDBACK MECHANISM \\n8-32. A formal assessment with meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate\\ndecision maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, when, where, and why\\nof that presentation. The commander and staff also discuss feedback leading up to and following that\\npresentation. Feedback might include which assessment working groups the commander requires and how to\\nact on and follow up on recommendations.\\nASSESSMENT WITHIN THE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n8-33.

For Army forces, operational art seeks to ensure that commanders employ forces, material, and time\\neffectively to achieve objectives. It requires a broad vision, the ability to anticipate, a careful understanding\\nof means to ends, and an understanding of inherent risk. Always within the context of a higher echelon joint\\nplan or order, using operational art helps Army commanders and staffs understand, visualize, and describe\\noperations, as shown in figure 2-4 on page 39.\\nPlanning and Operational Art \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 39 \\nFigure 2-4. Operational art \\n2-48. Operational art helps commanders to determine when, where, and for what purpose to employ forces\\nand to determine the sequence of those forces in major operations and battles. It requires commanders and\\nstaffs to answer these questions:\\n• What conditions, when established, constitute the desired end state (ends)?\\n• How will the force achieve these desired conditions (ways)?\\n• What sequence of actions helps attain these conditions (ways)?\\n• What resources are required to accomplish that sequence of actions (means)?\\n• What is the chance of failure or unacceptable consequences in performing that sequence of actions\\n(risk)?\\n2-49. Both ADM (described in Chapter 4) and the MDMP (described in Chapter 5) are tools used by Army\\ncommanders and their staffs in the application of operational art. ADM supports operational art as a\\nmethodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe problems and\\napproaches to solving them. ADM is associated with conceptual planning that helps commanders and staffs\\nframe an OE, frame ill-defined problems, and develop an operational approach to resolve identified problems.\\nThe understanding gained by both the process and specific outputs of ADM inform the more detailed\\nplanning conducted during the MDMP.\\n2-50. A key output of ADM is an operational approach. It is a broad description of the mission, operational\\nconcepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish the mission. The operational approach provides the\\nframework for operations, serves as the basis for detailed planning, and facilitates unity of purpose across the\\nforce. Operational art never occurs in a vacuum.   \n",

A reserve  is that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from\\naction at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3 -90).\\n1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power —the total means of destructive\\nand disruptive force that a military unit/formation can apply against an enemy at a given time (JP 3 -0).\\nD\\nesignating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and\\npriorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times\\nduring an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success  at the time.\\n1-40. Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets necessary to accomplish the\\nmission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort\\nin an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the\\ncurrent tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when\\npositioning their reserve. While commanders can assign their reserve a wide variety of tasks, throu gh\\npl\\nanning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution\\nas the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit\\nhas support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5 -0). Priorities of\\nmovement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support tha t commanders may use to\\nweight the main effort.\\nANTICIPATE EVENTS \\n1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and\\ncoordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated\\nuncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain.

Planners conduct a troop-to-task analysis to determine \\nthe type of units and capabilities needed to accomplish these tasks.\\n5-100. Planners proceed to initially array friendly forces on the sketch, starting with the forces executing the\\nessential task and planning backwards in time, continuing with those units executing supporting tasks and\\nreserve requirements. The initial array focu ses on generic ground maneuver units without regard to specific\\ntype or task organization, and then planners consider all appropriate intangible factors. Planners array ground\\nforces two levels below their echelon. For example, at division level, planners array generic battalions.\\nDuring this step, planners do not assign missions to specific units; they only consider which forces are\\nnecessary to accomplish their task.\\nChapter 5 \\n102 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n5-101. The initial array identifies the total number of units needed, including the reserve, and it identifies\\npossible methods of dealing with enemy forces and stability tasks. If the number of units arrayed is less than\\nthe number available, planners place additional units in a pool for use when they develop the initial concept\\nof operations. If the number of units arrayed exceeds the number available, and the difference cannot be\\ncompensated for with intangible factors, the staff determines whether the COA is f easible or not. Ways to\\nmake up shortfalls include requesting additional resources, accepting risk in that portion of the assigned area,\\nha\\nving units execute multiple tasks, or executing tasks required for the COA sequentially rather than\\nsimultaneously.\\nDevelop the Concept of Operations \\n5-102. Once forces are arrayed, the staff develops a concept of operations for each COA. The concept of\\noperations describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the mission within the commander ’s intent. I t\\nco\\nncisely expresses the “how” of the commander’s visualization and governs the design of supporting plans\\nor annexes. The concept of operations summarizes the contributions of all warfighting functions, ensures the\\nholistic application of combat power, and links together the various efforts of subordinate units into a\\ncohesive operation.\\n5-103.

The unit mission\\ns\\ntatement, along with the commander ’s intent, provide the primary focus for subordinate actions during\\nplanning, preparing, executing, and assessing. The commander either directs or receives and approves,\\nmodifies, or rejects the staff ’s proposed mission statement. Generally, the mission statement is approved\\nduring the mission analysis brief or shortly after the brief prior to moving forward in the process.\\n5-60. The who, where, and when  of a mission statement are straightforward. The what  and why are more\\nchallenging to write and can confuse subordinates if not stated clearly.

Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. \\nTime, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The\\ncommander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum\\ntime for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of\\ntwo-thirds of available time for subordinate units to conduct their planning and preparation. This leaves\\none-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the\\nother two -thirds for their own preparation. Commanders should c onsider when an order is issued to\\nsubordinate units. For example, an order transmitted at 0300 to meet the one -third, two-thirds rule may not\\ngive subordinate units adequate time to effectively plan.\\n5-23. Commanders and staffs also consider their higher echelon headquarters ’ timeline, their operational\\ntimeline, their planning timeline, anticipated enemy timelines, light and weather, and other essential factors.\\nA useful technique to help the commander and staff visualize the relationships and synchronization between\\nthese timelines is to build a higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data  timeline (also\\nknown as a HOPE[W/L] timeline). Figure 5 -3 depicts a sample higher, operational, pla nning, enemy, and\\nweather and light data timeline.\\nThe Military Decision-Making Process \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 83 \\nFigure 5-3. Sample higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data timeline  \\n5-24. Based on the commander’s initial allocation of time, the COS or XO approves a detailed staff planning\\ntimeline that outlines how long the headquarters can spend on each step of the MDMP. The staff planning\\ntimeline indicates what products are due, when they are due, who is responsible for them, and who receives\\nthem. It includes times and locations for meetings and briefings. It serves as a benchmark for the commander\\nand staff throughout the MDMP.   \n",

If the process can continue without making a particular assumption, the assumption is unnecessary and\\nnot used. So long as an assumption is both valid and necessary, leaders treat it as a fact. Leaders continually\\nseek to confirm or deny the validity of their assumptions. The confirmation or denial of an assumption ma y\\nr\\nequire the problem and plan to be reassessed.\\nOpinions \\n3-24. When gathering information, leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment\\nthat the leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result\\nof years of experience. Leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts,\\ninclude them as opinions, or reject them.\\nOrganizing Information \\n3-25. Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the\\nproblem or its solution. Leaders determine these requirements as they gather information. They coordinate\\nwith other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations\\nthat may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine. For an informal example, a squad\\nleader checks with the squad to the right to make sure the squads’ fields of fire overlap. For a formal example,\\na corps action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, leaders\\nalways coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present \\nit to the decision maker.\\nIDENTIFY THE PROBLEM \\n3-26. The next step in problem solving is recognizing and defining a problem. This step is crucial, as the\\nproblem may not be obvious. Therefore, leaders determine what the problem is by clearly defining its scope\\nArmy Problem Solving \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 51 \\nand limitations. Leaders should allow sufficient time and resources to clearly define the problem before \\nmoving on to other steps in the process. \\n3-27.

They provide advice on Army capabilities and resources, force and resource posturing, and \\nthe conduct of operations from a land perspective. In addition, the theater  army develops a \\ntheater support plan to the CCP. This plan includes methods to achieve security cooperation, \\ntraining and exercise programs, and ongoing Army activities within the theater, including \\nintelligence, air and missile defense, sustainment, and communications. (See FM 3-94 and \\nATP 3-93 for a detailed discussion of the roles, responsibilities, and organization of theater \\narmies.) \\nContingency Plans \\n2-31. A key aspect of combatant command planning is the development of contingency plans. A contingency\\nplan is a branch of a campaign plan that is planned based on hypothetical situations for designated threats,\\ncatastrophic events, and contingent missions outside of crisis conditions (JP 5- 0). Contingency plans are\\nbranches to global, regional, functional, and combatant campaign plans that address potential threats that put\\none or more national interests at risk in ways that warrant military operations. Contingency plans are built to\\naccount for the possibility that campaign activities could fail to prevent aggression, fail to preclude large\\nscale instability in a key state or region, or fail to adequately respond to a natural disaster. The UCP, CPG,\\nand JSCP assign CCDRs responsibilities for developing specific contingency plans. CCDRs also develop\\ncontingency plans to their CCPs based on theater estimates.\\n2-32. Contingency plans address an anticipated crisis, and they must be modified during execution to respond \\nto conditions at the time of execution. If an approved contingency plan exists that closely resembles the\\nemerging scenario, that plan can be refined or adapted as necessary and executed. Contingency plans are\\noften phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable\\nto the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termina tion criteria. They\\naddress military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n2-33.

The levels of warfare distinguish four broad overlapping activities: providing national direction and\\ncreating national strategy (national strategic), conducting continuous theater campaigning (theater strategic);\\nplanning and conducting campaigns and major operations (operational); or planning and executing\\noperations, battles, engagements, and actions (tactical). Different commanders act at more than one level of\\nwar, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates\\nt\\nheater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campai gn\\nde\\nsign and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without\\nfinite limits or boundaries. They do, however, c orrelate to specific activities and responsibilities. They help\\ncommanders visualize the relationships and actions required to link strategic objectives, military operations\\nat various echelons, and tactical actions. Among the levels of warfare, planning horizons, methods, and\\nproducts differ greatly. Without this context, tactical operations become disconnected from operational end\\nstates and strategic objectives. There are skills and practices related to strategic, theater strategic, operational,\\nand tactical level that differ from each other and are enhanced by specific training and education.\\nNATIONAL STRATEGIC LEVEL \\n2-5. The national strategic level of warfare is the level of warfare at which the U.S. government formulates\\npolicy goals and ways to achieve them by synchronizing action across government and unified action partners \\nand employing the instruments of national power (FM 3-0).

Situational understanding is product of applying analysis\\nand judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission\\nvariables.\\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\nA-2. An operational environment (OE) is the aggregate of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that\\naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. For Army forces, an OE\\nincludes portions of the land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains understood through three\\ndimensions (human, information, and physical).

When problems are difficult to identify, the operation’s end state is unclear, or a course of action (COA)\\nis not self-evident, commanders employ ADM. This is often the case when developing long- range plans for\\nextended operations. ADM is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them. ADM is particularly useful as an aid to\\nconceptual planning, but it must be integrated with the detailed planning typically associated with the MDMP\\nto produce executable plans and orders. ADM may be conducted before, concurrent with, or after the MDMP. \\nThere is no one way or prescribed set of steps to employ the ADM. There are, however, several activities\\nassociated with ADM including—\\n• Framing an OE.\\n• Framing problems.\\n• Developing an operational approach.\\n• Reframing (as required).\\n1-55. While planners complete some activities before others, the understanding and learning within one\\nactivity may require revisiting the learning from another activity. Based on their understanding and learning\\ngained during ADM, commanders issue planning guidance—including an operational approach—to guide\\nmore detailed planning using the MDMP. (See Chapter 4 for information on employing ADM.)\\nTHE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n1-56. The MDMP is an iterative planning methodology used to understand the problem or problems,\\nunderstand the situation and mission, develop COAs, decide on a COA, and produce an OPLAN or order. It\\nis an orderly, analytical process that integrates the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate\\nheadquarters in the development of a plan or order. The MDMP helps leaders apply thoroughness, clarity,\\nsound judgement, logic, and professional knowledge to develop situational understanding and produce a plan\\nor order that accomplishes the mission.\\nNote. Depending on the situation, including the time available for planning, commanders may \\ninitiate the MDMP without the benefits of conducting ADM   \n",

Integrated planning \\n1-51. The commander personally leads the conceptual component of planning. While commanders are\\nengaged in parts of detailed planning, they leave most specifics to staff officers. Conceptual planning\\nprovides the basis for subsequent planning. The commander’ s intent and operational approach provide the\\nframework for the entire plan. This framework leads to a concept of operations and associated schemes of\\nsupport, such as schemes of maneuver, intelligence, fires, protection, engineer operations, information, and\\ns\\nustainment. In turn, the schemes of support lead to the specifics of execution, including tasks to subordinate\\nunits and attachments (including annexes, appendices, tabs, and exhibits) to the base OPLAN or OPORD.\\nHowever, this dynamic does not operate in only one direction. Conceptual planning must respond to detailed\\nconstraints. For example, the realities of a deployment schedule (a detailed concern) influence the operational \\napproach (a conceptual concern).\\n1-52. Planning requires the integration of both conceptual thinking and detailed analysis. Army leaders\\nemploy several methodologies for planning, determining the appropriate mix based on the scope and\\nunderstanding of the problem, time available, and availability of a staff. Army planning methodologies\\ninclude—\\n• Army problem solving.\\n• Army design methodology (ADM).\\n• The military decision-making process (MDMP).\\n• Rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP).\\n• Troop leading procedures (TLP).\\nARMY PROBLEM SOLVING \\n1-53. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for Army leaders. Army\\nproblem solving forms the base logic of other planning methodologies. Where other methodologies are\\ndesigned for planning operations, Army problem solving is a methodology available for leaders to use to\\ni\\ndentify and solve a variety of problems both in garrison and in operations. Army problem solving is an\\nanalytical approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the\\nbest solution, developing a plan, and implementing that plan to solve the problem.

A planning team normally consists of a lead planner from the G -5, G-3, or \\nS-3 sections and representatives from each warfighting function. Additional staff members by area of\\nexpertise, liaison officers, and unified action partners are added to the team as required. When trying to plan\\ncollaboratively, those organizations or subordinate units must be notified to ensure the right personnel are\\nidentified to support the planning effort. Typically, for new missions or large planning efforts, the planning\\nteam may consist of representatives from all staff sections and unit liaison officers.

From this\\nanalysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all\\ntasks.

The commander and staff identify any constraints placed on their command. A constraint  is a\\nrestriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus\\nrestricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the\\nOPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example,\\nmay contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs,\\nor in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a\\nstarting point to their analysis.\\n5-41. Constraints could also be based on resource limitations in the command, information release\\nrestrictions, or legal constraints. Resource limitations may include the number of capabilities provided or the\\navailability of collection capabilities to support a n operation. The staff judge advocate provides review of\\nlegal constraints. The constraints may include rules of engagement or authorities in the OPLAN, OPORD, or\\nrelated documents.\\nIdentify Facts and Develop Assumptions \\n5-42.

Both types of joint plans have four levels of details: commander ’s estimate, base plan, co ncept\\nplan, and OPLAN.\\nD-4. An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of\\noperations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time -phased force and deployment list (JP 5- 0). An\\nOPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be\\ndeveloped for a single part or phase of a long- term operation. An OPLAN becomes an operation order\\n(OPORD) when the commander sets an execution time or designates an event that triggers the operation.\\nD-5. A supporting plan is an operation plan prepared by a supporting commander, a subordinate\\ncommander, or an agency to satisfy the requests or requirements of the supported commander’s plan (JP 5-0).\\nF\\nor example, an ARFOR commander develops a supporting plan for how Army forces will support the joint\\nforce commander’s campaign plan or OPLAN.\\nAppendix D \\n198 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nD-6. A branch is the contingency options built into the base plan. A branch is used for changing the mission,\\norientation, or direction of movement of a force to aid success of the operation based on anticipated events,\\nopportunities, or disruptions caused by enemy actions and reactions. Branches add flexibility to plans by\\nanticipating situations that could alter the basic plan or order.\\nD-7. A sequel is the subsequent major operation or phase based on the possible outcomes of the current\\nmajor operation or phase. For every action or major operation that does not accomplish a strategic or\\noperational objective, there should be a sequel for each possible outcome, such as win, lose, draw, or decisive\\nwin.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS \\nD-8.

Planning keeps the force oriented on future objectives despite the requirements of current operations.\\nPlanning is essential for seizing and retaining the initiative by allowing commanders and staffs to consider\\npotential decisions and actions in advance. Planning reduces the time between decisions and actions during\\nexecution, especially at higher echelons. While some actions are implemented immediately, others require\\nforethought and preparation. For example, changing the direction of attack may be a relatively simple and\\nimmediate matter for a battalion; however, changing the scheme of maneuver for a division, including all its\\nsupport, is complicated and time consuming. Changing the priority of fires at division level may take\\nconsiderable time if artillery units must reposition. If leaders wait until an event occurs to begin planning and\\npreparing for a response, units may not be able to react quickly enough, ceding the initiative to enemy forces.\\n1-45. During execution planners continue to develop or refine options for potential enemy action and friendly \\nopportunities. By anticipating potential events and transitions beforehand, planning promotes flexibility a nd\\nr\\napid decision making during execution. As  a result, the force anticipates events and acts purposefully and\\neffectively before the enemy can act or before situations deteriorate. Several tools are available to the\\ncommander and planners to assist in adapting to changing circumstances. These tools include —\\n• Decision points.\\n• Branches.\\n• Sequels.\\n1-46. A decision point is a point in space and the latest time when the commander or staff anticipates making\\na key decision concerning a specific course of action ( JP 5-0). A decision point is associated to actions by\\nthe enemy, the friendly force, or the population, and it is tied to a commander ’s critical information\\nrequirement (CCIR). Examples of friendly actions associated with a decision point range from a single tas k\\nt\\no a subordinate unit to the force as a whole in executing a branch or sequel.

After\\nforming a framework for the operational approach using lines of operations and lines of effort, commanders\\nand planning teams consider additional elements of operational art to refine the operational approach.\\nAdditional elements of operational art to consider include—\\n• Operational reach, basing, and culmination.\\n• Tempo.\\n• Phasing and transitions.\\n• Risk.\\nOperational Reach, Basing, and Culmination \\n4-81. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ its\\ncapabilities. The skillful positioning of forces, reserves, bases, and equipment extend operational reach.\\nAlthough reach might be constrained or limited by the geography, enemy forces, and adversaries in and\\naround an operational area, reach is extended by—\\n• Forward positioning of capabilities and resources.\\n• Increasing the range and effectiveness of weapons systems.\\n• Leveraging host-nation support and contract support.\\n4-82. Basing, in the broadest sense, is an indispensable part of operational art. It is tied to lines of operations,\\nand it affects operational reach. In particular, the arrangement and positioning of bases in an operational area\\nunderwrites the ability of the force to protect its components from enemy action while expanding the distance \\nand duration of its capabilities. Commanders consider bases and base camps as intermediate staging bases,\\nlodgments (subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases as\\npart of the operational approach.\\n4-83. Commanders consider culmination when developing their operational approach and visualizi ng\\nr\\nesources to support it. Culmination is that point in time and space at which a force no longer possesses the\\ncapability to continue its current form of operations. Culmination means a shift in relative combat power. It\\nis relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare. While conducting offensive tasks, th e\\nc\\nulminating point occurs when the force cannot continue the attack, and it assumes a defensive posture or\\nexecutes an operational pause. While conducting defensive tasks, it occurs when the force cannot   \n",

Assessment information requirements compete with other information\\nrequirements for resources. When an information requirement is not resourced, staffs cannot collect the\\nassociated indicator and must remove it from the plan. Staffs then adjust the assessment framework to ensure\\nthat the MOE or MOP is properly worded.\\nSTEP 5 - ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS AND GENERATING\\nRECOMMENDATIONS \\n8-31.  In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, commanders assign staff members to analyze\\nassessment data and develop recommendations. For example, the intelligence officer leads the assessment of\\nenemy forces. The engineer officer leads the effort on assessing infrastructure and development. The civil\\naffairs operations officer leads assessment concerning the progress of local and provincial governments. The\\nchief of staff (COS ) aggressively requires staff principals and subject matter experts to participate in\\nprocessing the formal assessment and in generating smart, actionable recommendations. The operations\\nresearch and analysis officer assists the commander and staff with developing both assessment frameworks\\nand the command’s assessment process.\\nSTEP 6 - IDENTIFY FEEDBACK MECHANISM \\n8-32. A formal assessment with meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate\\ndecision maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, when, where, and why\\nof that presentation. The commander and staff also discuss feedback leading up to and following that\\npresentation. Feedback might include which assessment working groups the commander requires and how to\\nact on and follow up on recommendations.\\nASSESSMENT WITHIN THE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n8-33.

For Army forces, operational art seeks to ensure that commanders employ forces, material, and time\\neffectively to achieve objectives. It requires a broad vision, the ability to anticipate, a careful understanding\\nof means to ends, and an understanding of inherent risk. Always within the context of a higher echelon joint\\nplan or order, using operational art helps Army commanders and staffs understand, visualize, and describe\\noperations, as shown in figure 2-4 on page 39.\\nPlanning and Operational Art \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 39 \\nFigure 2-4. Operational art \\n2-48. Operational art helps commanders to determine when, where, and for what purpose to employ forces\\nand to determine the sequence of those forces in major operations and battles. It requires commanders and\\nstaffs to answer these questions:\\n• What conditions, when established, constitute the desired end state (ends)?\\n• How will the force achieve these desired conditions (ways)?\\n• What sequence of actions helps attain these conditions (ways)?\\n• What resources are required to accomplish that sequence of actions (means)?\\n• What is the chance of failure or unacceptable consequences in performing that sequence of actions\\n(risk)?\\n2-49. Both ADM (described in Chapter 4) and the MDMP (described in Chapter 5) are tools used by Army\\ncommanders and their staffs in the application of operational art. ADM supports operational art as a\\nmethodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe problems and\\napproaches to solving them. ADM is associated with conceptual planning that helps commanders and staffs\\nframe an OE, frame ill-defined problems, and develop an operational approach to resolve identified problems.\\nThe understanding gained by both the process and specific outputs of ADM inform the more detailed\\nplanning conducted during the MDMP.\\n2-50. A key output of ADM is an operational approach. It is a broad description of the mission, operational\\nconcepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish the mission. The operational approach provides the\\nframework for operations, serves as the basis for detailed planning, and facilitates unity of purpose across the\\nforce. Operational art never occurs in a vacuum.   \n",

A reserve  is that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from\\naction at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3 -90).\\n1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power —the total means of destructive\\nand disruptive force that a military unit/formation can apply against an enemy at a given time (JP 3 -0).\\nD\\nesignating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and\\npriorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times\\nduring an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success  at the time.\\n1-40. Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets necessary to accomplish the\\nmission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort\\nin an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the\\ncurrent tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when\\npositioning their reserve. While commanders can assign their reserve a wide variety of tasks, throu gh\\npl\\nanning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution\\nas the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit\\nhas support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5 -0). Priorities of\\nmovement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support tha t commanders may use to\\nweight the main effort.\\nANTICIPATE EVENTS \\n1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and\\ncoordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated\\nuncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain.

Planners conduct a troop-to-task analysis to determine \\nthe type of units and capabilities needed to accomplish these tasks.\\n5-100. Planners proceed to initially array friendly forces on the sketch, starting with the forces executing the\\nessential task and planning backwards in time, continuing with those units executing supporting tasks and\\nreserve requirements. The initial array focu ses on generic ground maneuver units without regard to specific\\ntype or task organization, and then planners consider all appropriate intangible factors. Planners array ground\\nforces two levels below their echelon. For example, at division level, planners array generic battalions.\\nDuring this step, planners do not assign missions to specific units; they only consider which forces are\\nnecessary to accomplish their task.\\nChapter 5 \\n102 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n5-101. The initial array identifies the total number of units needed, including the reserve, and it identifies\\npossible methods of dealing with enemy forces and stability tasks. If the number of units arrayed is less than\\nthe number available, planners place additional units in a pool for use when they develop the initial concept\\nof operations. If the number of units arrayed exceeds the number available, and the difference cannot be\\ncompensated for with intangible factors, the staff determines whether the COA is f easible or not. Ways to\\nmake up shortfalls include requesting additional resources, accepting risk in that portion of the assigned area,\\nha\\nving units execute multiple tasks, or executing tasks required for the COA sequentially rather than\\nsimultaneously.\\nDevelop the Concept of Operations \\n5-102. Once forces are arrayed, the staff develops a concept of operations for each COA. The concept of\\noperations describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the mission within the commander ’s intent.

The unit mission\\ns\\ntatement, along with the commander ’s intent, provide the primary focus for subordinate actions during\\nplanning, preparing, executing, and assessing. The commander either directs or receives and approves,\\nmodifies, or rejects the staff ’s proposed mission statement. Generally, the mission statement is approved\\nduring the mission analysis brief or shortly after the brief prior to moving forward in the process.\\n5-60. The who, where, and when  of a mission statement are straightforward. The what  and why are more\\nchallenging to write and can confuse subordinates if not stated clearly. The what of a mission statement is\\nalways a task and expressed in terms of action verbs. The task within a mission statement is not required to\\nbe a tactical mission task.

Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. \\nTime, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The\\ncommander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum\\ntime for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of\\ntwo-thirds of available time for subordinate units to conduct their planning and preparation. This leaves\\none-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the\\nother two -thirds for their own preparation. Commanders should c onsider when an order is issued to\\nsubordinate units. For example, an order transmitted at 0300 to meet the one -third, two-thirds rule may not\\ngive subordinate units adequate time to effectively plan.\\n5-23. Commanders and staffs also consider their higher echelon headquarters ’ timeline, their operational\\ntimeline, their planning timeline, anticipated enemy timelines, light and weather, and other essential factors.\\nA useful technique to help the commander and staff visualize the relationships and synchronization between\\nthese timelines is to build a higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data  timeline (also\\nknown as a HOPE[W/L] timeline). Figure 5 -3 depicts a sample higher, operational, pla nning, enemy, and\\nweather and light data timeline.\\nThe Military Decision-Making Process \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 83 \\nFigure 5-3.

Based on the commander’s initial allocation of time, the COS or XO approves a detailed staff planning\\ntimeline that outlines how long the headquarters can spend on each step of the MDMP. The staff planning\\ntimeline indicates what products are due, when they are due, who is responsible for them, and who receives\\nthem. It includes times and locations for meetings and briefings. It serves as a benchmark for the commander\\nand staff throughout the MDMP.   \n",

If the process can continue without making a particular assumption, the assumption is unnecessary and\\nnot used. So long as an assumption is both valid and necessary, leaders treat it as a fact. Leaders continually\\nseek to confirm or deny the validity of their assumptions. The confirmation or denial of an assumption ma y\\nr\\nequire the problem and plan to be reassessed.\\nOpinions \\n3-24. When gathering information, leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment\\nthat the leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result\\nof years of experience. Leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts,\\ninclude them as opinions, or reject them.\\nOrganizing Information \\n3-25. Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the\\nproblem or its solution. Leaders determine these requirements as they gather information. They coordinate\\nwith other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations\\nthat may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine. For an informal example, a squad\\nleader checks with the squad to the right to make sure the squads’ fields of fire overlap. For a formal example,\\na corps action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, leaders\\nalways coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present \\nit to the decision maker.\\nIDENTIFY THE PROBLEM \\n3-26. The next step in problem solving is recognizing and defining a problem. This step is crucial, as the\\nproblem may not be obvious. Therefore, leaders determine what the problem is by clearly defining its scope\\nArmy Problem Solving \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 51 \\nand limitations. Leaders should allow sufficient time and resources to clearly define the problem before \\nmoving on to other steps in the process. \\n3-27.

They provide advice on Army capabilities and resources, force and resource posturing, and \\nthe conduct of operations from a land perspective. In addition, the theater  army develops a \\ntheater support plan to the CCP. This plan includes methods to achieve security cooperation, \\ntraining and exercise programs, and ongoing Army activities within the theater, including \\nintelligence, air and missile defense, sustainment, and communications. (See FM 3-94 and \\nATP 3-93 for a detailed discussion of the roles, responsibilities, and organization of theater \\narmies.) \\nContingency Plans \\n2-31. A key aspect of combatant command planning is the development of contingency plans. A contingency\\nplan is a branch of a campaign plan that is planned based on hypothetical situations for designated threats,\\ncatastrophic events, and contingent missions outside of crisis conditions (JP 5- 0). Contingency plans are\\nbranches to global, regional, functional, and combatant campaign plans that address potential threats that put\\none or more national interests at risk in ways that warrant military operations. Contingency plans are built to\\naccount for the possibility that campaign activities could fail to prevent aggression, fail to preclude large\\nscale instability in a key state or region, or fail to adequately respond to a natural disaster. The UCP, CPG,\\nand JSCP assign CCDRs responsibilities for developing specific contingency plans. CCDRs also develop\\ncontingency plans to their CCPs based on theater estimates.\\n2-32. Contingency plans address an anticipated crisis, and they must be modified during execution to respond \\nto conditions at the time of execution. If an approved contingency plan exists that closely resembles the\\nemerging scenario, that plan can be refined or adapted as necessary and executed. Contingency plans are\\noften phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable\\nto the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termina tion criteria. They\\naddress military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n2-33.

The levels of warfare distinguish four broad overlapping activities: providing national direction and\\ncreating national strategy (national strategic), conducting continuous theater campaigning (theater strategic);\\nplanning and conducting campaigns and major operations (operational); or planning and executing\\noperations, battles, engagements, and actions (tactical). Different commanders act at more than one level of\\nwar, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates\\nt\\nheater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campai gn\\nde\\nsign and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without\\nfinite limits or boundaries. They do, however, c orrelate to specific activities and responsibilities. They help\\ncommanders visualize the relationships and actions required to link strategic objectives, military operations\\nat various echelons, and tactical actions. Among the levels of warfare, planning horizons, methods, and\\nproducts differ greatly. Without this context, tactical operations become disconnected from operational end\\nstates and strategic objectives. There are skills and practices related to strategic, theater strategic, operational,\\nand tactical level that differ from each other and are enhanced by specific training and education.\\nNATIONAL STRATEGIC LEVEL \\n2-5. The national strategic level of warfare is the level of warfare at which the U.S. government formulates\\npolicy goals and ways to achieve them by synchronizing action across government and unified action partners \\nand employing the instruments of national power (FM 3-0).

Success during operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgement to\\navailable information and knowledge. As such, commanders and staffs seek to build and maintain situational\\nunderstanding throughout the operations process. Situational understanding is product of applying analysis\\nand judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission\\nvariables.\\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\nA-2. An operational environment (OE) is the aggregate of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that\\naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. For Army forces, an OE\\nincludes portions of the land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains understood through three\\ndimensions (human, information, and physical). The land, maritime, air, and space domains are defined by\\nt\\nheir physical areas. The cyberspace domain, a man -made network of networks, transits and connects  the\\not\\nher domains through the electromagnetic spectrum. (See FM 3-0 for a more detailed discussion of an OE.)\\nA-3. Understanding an OE forms the basis for decision making during planning, preparation, execution, and\\nassessment of an operation. To help buil d this understanding, leaders analyze and describe an OE through\\nthe operational variables—a comprehensive set of information categories used to describe an   \n",

When problems are difficult to identify, the operation’s end state is unclear, or a course of action (COA)\\nis not self-evident, commanders employ ADM. This is often the case when developing long- range plans for\\nextended operations. ADM is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them. ADM is particularly useful as an aid to\\nconceptual planning, but it must be integrated with the detailed planning typically associated with the MDMP\\nto produce executable plans and orders. ADM may be conducted before, concurrent with, or after the MDMP. \\nThere is no one way or prescribed set of steps to employ the ADM. There are, however, several activities\\nassociated with ADM including—\\n• Framing an OE.\\n• Framing problems.\\n• Developing an operational approach.\\n• Reframing (as required).\\n1-55. While planners complete some activities before others, the understanding and learning within one\\nactivity may require revisiting the learning from another activity. Based on their understanding and learning\\ngained during ADM, commanders issue planning guidance—including an operational approach—to guide\\nmore detailed planning using the MDMP. (See Chapter 4 for information on employing ADM.)\\nTHE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n1-56. The MDMP is an iterative planning methodology used to understand the problem or problems,\\nunderstand the situation and mission, develop COAs, decide on a COA, and produce an OPLAN or order. It\\nis an orderly, analytical process that integrates the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate\\nheadquarters in the development of a plan or order. The MDMP helps leaders apply thoroughness, clarity,\\nsound judgement, logic, and professional knowledge to develop situational understanding and produce a plan\\nor order that accomplishes the mission.\\nNote. Depending on the situation, including the time available for planning, commanders may \\ninitiate the MDMP without the benefits of conducting ADM   \n",

Integrated planning \\n1-51. The commander personally leads the conceptual component of planning. While commanders are\\nengaged in parts of detailed planning, they leave most specifics to staff officers. Conceptual planning\\nprovides the basis for subsequent planning. The commander’ s intent and operational approach provide the\\nframework for the entire plan. This framework leads to a concept of operations and associated schemes of\\nsupport, such as schemes of maneuver, intelligence, fires, protection, engineer operations, information, and\\ns\\nustainment. In turn, the schemes of support lead to the specifics of execution, including tasks to subordinate\\nunits and attachments (including annexes, appendices, tabs, and exhibits) to the base OPLAN or OPORD.\\nHowever, this dynamic does not operate in only one direction. Conceptual planning must respond to detailed\\nconstraints. For example, the realities of a deployment schedule (a detailed concern) influence the operational \\napproach (a conceptual concern).\\n1-52. Planning requires the integration of both conceptual thinking and detailed analysis. Army leaders\\nemploy several methodologies for planning, determining the appropriate mix based on the scope and\\nunderstanding of the problem, time available, and availability of a staff. Army planning methodologies\\ninclude—\\n• Army problem solving.\\n• Army design methodology (ADM).\\n• The military decision-making process (MDMP).\\n• Rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP).\\n• Troop leading procedures (TLP).\\nARMY PROBLEM SOLVING \\n1-53. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for Army leaders. Army\\nproblem solving forms the base logic of other planning methodologies. Where other methodologies are\\ndesigned for planning operations, Army problem solving is a methodology available for leaders to use to\\ni\\ndentify and solve a variety of problems both in garrison and in operations. Army problem solving is an\\nanalytical approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the\\nbest solution, developing a plan, and implementing that plan to solve the problem.

The purpose of this step is to establish conditions for successful planning. This step focuses on alerting\\nthe staff, forming the planning team, assessing available time for planning, and deciding on a planning\\napproach.

When the unit receives a new mission or a planning requirement is identified, the staff is alerted and\\nbegins necessary preparation. There are times when staff members will need to alert the commander to an\\norder.

Unit standard operating \\nprocedures (SOPs) should establish notification procedures and identify standard planning teams based on \\nthe anticipated planning effort. A planning team normally consists of a lead planner from the G -5, G-3, or \\nS-3 sections and representatives from each warfighting function. Additional staff members by area of\\nexpertise, liaison officers, and unified action partners are added to the team as required. When trying to plan\\ncollaboratively, those organizations or subordinate units must be notified to ensure the right personnel are\\nidentified to support the planning effort. Typically, for new missions or large planning efforts, the planning\\nteam may consist of representatives from all staff sections and unit liaison officers.

They consider\\nrelationships among specified, implied, and essential tasks and available assets. Staff officers use th e\\nc\\napabilities and resources recorded in their running estima tes as a starting point for their analysis. From this\\nanalysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all\\ntasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commander s a rough\\nc\\nomparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may\\nrequest from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success.\\nStaffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commander s to\\nunde\\nrstand and consider when developing the planning guidance.

The commander and staff identify any constraints placed on their command. A constraint  is a\\nrestriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus\\nrestricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the\\nOPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example,\\nmay contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs,\\nor in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a\\nstarting point to their analysis.\\n5-41. Constraints could also be based on resource limitations in the command, information release\\nrestrictions, or legal constraints. Resource limitations may include the number of capabilities provided or the\\navailability of collection capabilities to support a n operation. The staff judge advocate provides review of\\nlegal constraints. The constraints may include rules of engagement or authorities in the OPLAN, OPORD, or\\nrelated documents.\\nIdentify Facts and Develop Assumptions \\n5-42.

Both types of joint plans have four levels of details: commander ’s estimate, base plan, co ncept\\nplan, and OPLAN.\\nD-4. An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of\\noperations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time -phased force and deployment list (JP 5- 0). An\\nOPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be\\ndeveloped for a single part or phase of a long- term operation. An OPLAN becomes an operation order\\n(OPORD) when the commander sets an execution time or designates an event that triggers the operation.\\nD-5. A supporting plan is an operation plan prepared by a supporting commander, a subordinate\\ncommander, or an agency to satisfy the requests or requirements of the supported commander’s plan (JP 5-0).\\nF\\nor example, an ARFOR commander develops a supporting plan for how Army forces will support the joint\\nforce commander’s campaign plan or OPLAN.\\nAppendix D \\n198 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nD-6. A branch is the contingency options built into the base plan. A branch is used for changing the mission,\\norientation, or direction of movement of a force to aid success of the operation based on anticipated events,\\nopportunities, or disruptions caused by enemy actions and reactions. Branches add flexibility to plans by\\nanticipating situations that could alter the basic plan or order.\\nD-7. A sequel is the subsequent major operation or phase based on the possible outcomes of the current\\nmajor operation or phase. For every action or major operation that does not accomplish a strategic or\\noperational objective, there should be a sequel for each possible outcome, such as win, lose, draw, or decisive\\nwin.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS \\nD-8.

It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in\\na\\ndvance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and third-\\norder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and\\nthreats.\\nChapter 1 \\n8 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n1-44. Planning keeps the force oriented on future objectives despite the requirements of current operations.\\nPlanning is essential for seizing and retaining the initiative by allowing commanders and staffs to consider\\npotential decisions and actions in advance. Planning reduces the time between decisions and actions during\\nexecution, especially at higher echelons. While some actions are implemented immediately, others require\\nforethought and preparation. For example, changing the direction of attack may be a relatively simple and\\nimmediate matter for a battalion; however, changing the scheme of maneuver for a division, including all its\\nsupport, is complicated and time consuming. Changing the priority of fires at division level may take\\nconsiderable time if artillery units must reposition. If leaders wait until an event occurs to begin planning and\\npreparing for a response, units may not be able to react quickly enough, ceding the initiative to enemy forces.\\n1-45. During execution planners continue to develop or refine options for potential enemy action and friendly \\nopportunities. By anticipating potential events and transitions beforehand, planning promotes flexibility a nd\\nr\\napid decision making during execution. As  a result, the force anticipates events and acts purposefully and\\neffectively before the enemy can act or before situations deteriorate. Several tools are available to the\\ncommander and planners to assist in adapting to changing circumstances. These tools include —\\n• Decision points.\\n• Branches.\\n• Sequels.\\n1-46. A decision point is a point in space and the latest time when the commander or staff anticipates making\\na key decision concerning a specific course of action ( JP 5-0). A decision point is associated to actions by\\nthe enemy, the friendly force, or the population, and it is tied to a commander ’s critical information\\nrequirement (CCIR). Examples of friendly actions associated with a decision point range from a single tas k\\nt\\no a subordinate unit to the force as a whole in executing a branch or sequel.

While an operational approach is broad, it describes the commander’s visualization in time, space, and\\npurpose. It also addresses resources required to support the operational approach and accounts for risk. After\\nforming a framework for the operational approach using lines of operations and lines of effort, commanders\\nand planning teams consider additional elements of operational art to refine the operational approach.\\nAdditional elements of operational art to consider include—\\n• Operational reach, basing, and culmination.\\n• Tempo.\\n• Phasing and transitions.\\n• Risk.\\nOperational Reach, Basing, and Culmination \\n4-81. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ its\\ncapabilities. The skillful positioning of forces, reserves, bases, and equipment extend operational reach.\\nAlthough reach might be constrained or limited by the geography, enemy forces, and adversaries in and\\naround an operational area, reach is extended by—\\n• Forward positioning of capabilities and resources.\\n• Increasing the range and effectiveness of weapons systems.\\n• Leveraging host-nation support and contract support.\\n4-82. Basing, in the broadest sense, is an indispensable part of operational art. It is tied to lines of operations,\\nand it affects operational reach. In particular, the arrangement and positioning of bases in an operational area\\nunderwrites the ability of the force to protect its components from enemy action while expanding the distance \\nand duration of its capabilities. Commanders consider bases and base camps as intermediate staging bases,\\nlodgments (subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases as\\npart of the operational approach.\\n4-83. Commanders consider culmination when developing their operational approach and visualizi ng\\nr\\nesources to support it. Culmination is that point in time and space at which a force no longer possesses the\\ncapability to continue its current form of operations. Culmination means a shift in relative combat power. It\\nis relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare. While conducting offensive tasks, th e\\nc\\nulminating point occurs when the force cannot continue the attack, and it assumes a defensive posture or\\nexecutes an operational pause. While conducting defensive tasks, it occurs when the force cannot   \n",

Assessment information requirements compete with other information\\nrequirements for resources. When an information requirement is not resourced, staffs cannot collect the\\nassociated indicator and must remove it from the plan. Staffs then adjust the assessment framework to ensure\\nthat the MOE or MOP is properly worded.\\nSTEP 5 - ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS AND GENERATING\\nRECOMMENDATIONS \\n8-31.  In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, commanders assign staff members to analyze\\nassessment data and develop recommendations. For example, the intelligence officer leads the assessment of\\nenemy forces. The engineer officer leads the effort on assessing infrastructure and development. The civil\\naffairs operations officer leads assessment concerning the progress of local and provincial governments. The\\nchief of staff (COS ) aggressively requires staff principals and subject matter experts to participate in\\nprocessing the formal assessment and in generating smart, actionable recommendations. The operations\\nresearch and analysis officer assists the commander and staff with developing both assessment frameworks\\nand the command’s assessment process.\\nSTEP 6 - IDENTIFY FEEDBACK MECHANISM \\n8-32. A formal assessment with meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate\\ndecision maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, when, where, and why\\nof that presentation. The commander and staff also discuss feedback leading up to and following that\\npresentation. Feedback might include which assessment working groups the commander requires and how to\\nact on and follow up on recommendations.\\nASSESSMENT WITHIN THE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n8-33. Formal assessment planning happens concurrent with each step of the MDMP. Throughout the process\\nthe assessment cell remains engaged with the planning team to ensure the assessment follows the logic of the\\nplan or order that will be produced and executed.

For Army forces, operational art seeks to ensure that commanders employ forces, material, and time\\neffectively to achieve objectives. It requires a broad vision, the ability to anticipate, a careful understanding\\nof means to ends, and an understanding of inherent risk. Always within the context of a higher echelon joint\\nplan or order, using operational art helps Army commanders and staffs understand, visualize, and describe\\noperations, as shown in figure 2-4 on page 39.\\nPlanning and Operational Art \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 39 \\nFigure 2-4. Operational art \\n2-48. Operational art helps commanders to determine when, where, and for what purpose to employ forces\\nand to determine the sequence of those forces in major operations and battles. It requires commanders and\\nstaffs to answer these questions:\\n• What conditions, when established, constitute the desired end state (ends)?\\n• How will the force achieve these desired conditions (ways)?\\n• What sequence of actions helps attain these conditions (ways)?\\n• What resources are required to accomplish that sequence of actions (means)?\\n• What is the chance of failure or unacceptable consequences in performing that sequence of actions\\n(risk)?\\n2-49. Both ADM (described in Chapter 4) and the MDMP (described in Chapter 5) are tools used by Army\\ncommanders and their staffs in the application of operational art. ADM supports operational art as a\\nmethodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe problems and\\napproaches to solving them. ADM is associated with conceptual planning that helps commanders and staffs\\nframe an OE, frame ill-defined problems, and develop an operational approach to resolve identified problems.\\nThe understanding gained by both the process and specific outputs of ADM inform the more detailed\\nplanning conducted during the MDMP.\\n2-50. A key output of ADM is an operational approach. It is a broad description of the mission, operational\\nconcepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish the mission. The operational approach provides the\\nframework for operations, serves as the basis for detailed planning, and facilitates unity of purpose across the\\nforce. Operational art never occurs in a vacuum.</td>\n",

A reserve  is that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from\\naction at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3 -90).\\n1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power —the total means of destructive\\nand disruptive force that a military unit/formation can apply against an enemy at a given time (JP 3 -0).\\nD\\nesignating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and\\npriorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times\\nduring an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success  at the time.\\n1-40. Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets necessary to accomplish the\\nmission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort\\nin an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the\\ncurrent tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when\\npositioning their reserve. While commanders can assign their reserve a wide variety of tasks, throu gh\\npl\\nanning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution\\nas the situation requires.

Planners conduct a troop-to-task analysis to determine \\nthe type of units and capabilities needed to accomplish these tasks.\\n5-100. Planners proceed to initially array friendly forces on the sketch, starting with the forces executing the\\nessential task and planning backwards in time, continuing with those units executing supporting tasks and\\nreserve requirements. The initial array focu ses on generic ground maneuver units without regard to specific\\ntype or task organization, and then planners consider all appropriate intangible factors. Planners array ground\\nforces two levels below their echelon. For example, at division level, planners array generic battalions.\\nDuring this step, planners do not assign missions to specific units; they only consider which forces are\\nnecessary to accomplish their task.\\nChapter 5 \\n102 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n5-101. The initial array identifies the total number of units needed, including the reserve, and it identifies\\npossible methods of dealing with enemy forces and stability tasks. If the number of units arrayed is less than\\nthe number available, planners place additional units in a pool for use when they develop the initial concept\\nof operations. If the number of units arrayed exceeds the number available, and the difference cannot be\\ncompensated for with intangible factors, the staff determines whether the COA is f easible or not. Ways to\\nmake up shortfalls include requesting additional resources, accepting risk in that portion of the assigned area,\\nha\\nving units execute multiple tasks, or executing tasks required for the COA sequentially rather than\\nsimultaneously.\\nDevelop the Concept of Operations \\n5-102. Once forces are arrayed, the staff develops a concept of operations for each COA. The concept of\\noperations describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the mission within the commander ’s intent. I t\\nco\\nncisely expresses the “how” of the commander’s visualization and governs the design of supporting plans\\nor annexes. The concept of operations summarizes the contributions of all warfighting functions, ensures the\\nholistic application of combat power, and links together the various efforts of subordinate units into a\\ncohesive operation.\\n5-103.

The unit mission\\ns\\ntatement, along with the commander ’s intent, provide the primary focus for subordinate actions during\\nplanning, preparing, executing, and assessing. The commander either directs or receives and approves,\\nmodifies, or rejects the staff ’s proposed mission statement. Generally, the mission statement is approved\\nduring the mission analysis brief or shortly after the brief prior to moving forward in the process.\\n5-60. The who, where, and when  of a mission statement are straightforward. The what  and why are more\\nchallenging to write and can confuse subordinates if not stated clearly. The what of a mission statement is\\nalways a task and expressed in terms of action verbs. The task within a mission statement is not required to\\nbe a tactical mission task. It may be any task deemed essential to the mission. The why  puts the task into\\ncontext by describing the reason it is performed. The why  provides the mission’ s purpose—the reason the\\nunit is to perform the task and how it is intended to contribute to the higher echelon headquarters’ success. It\\nis integral to mission command and mission orders. With discussion and coordination from higher\\nheadquarters, subordinate commands may adjust the task, but not the purpose. The five elements of a mission\\nstatement answer these questions:\\nChapter 5 \\n92 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n• Who will execute the operation (unit or organization)?\\n• What is the unit’s essential task?\\n• When will the operation begin (by time or event) or what is the duration of the operation?\\n• Where will the operation occur (assigned areas, objective, or graphic control measure)?\\n• Why will the force conduct the operations (for what purpose)?\\nExample 1. 1-505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (who) seizes (what or task) AREA \\nNOTIONAL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (where) not later than D-day, H+3 (when) to allow \\nfollow-on forces to air-land into AO SPARTAN (why or purpose).  \\nExample 2.

Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. \\nTime, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The\\ncommander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum\\ntime for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of\\ntwo-thirds of available time for subordinate units to conduct their planning and preparation. This leaves\\none-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the\\nother two -thirds for their own preparation. Commanders should c onsider when an order is issued to\\nsubordinate units. For example, an order transmitted at 0300 to meet the one -third, two-thirds rule may not\\ngive subordinate units adequate time to effectively plan.\\n5-23. Commanders and staffs also consider their higher echelon headquarters ’ timeline, their operational\\ntimeline, their planning timeline, anticipated enemy timelines, light and weather, and other essential factors.\\nA useful technique to help the commander and staff visualize the relationships and synchronization between\\nthese timelines is to build a higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data  timeline (also\\nknown as a HOPE[W/L] timeline).

Based on the commander’s initial allocation of time, the COS or XO approves a detailed staff planning\\ntimeline that outlines how long the headquarters can spend on each step of the MDMP. The staff planning\\ntimeline indicates what products are due, when they are due, who is responsible for them, and who receives\\nthem. It includes times and locations for meetings and briefings. It serves as a benchmark for the commander\\nand staff throughout the MDMP.</td>\n",

If the process can continue without making a particular assumption, the assumption is unnecessary and\\nnot used. So long as an assumption is both valid and necessary, leaders treat it as a fact. Leaders continually\\nseek to confirm or deny the validity of their assumptions. The confirmation or denial of an assumption ma y\\nr\\nequire the problem and plan to be reassessed.\\nOpinions \\n3-24. When gathering information, leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment\\nthat the leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result\\nof years of experience. Leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts,\\ninclude them as opinions, or reject them.\\nOrganizing Information \\n3-25. Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the\\nproblem or its solution. Leaders determine these requirements as they gather information. They coordinate\\nwith other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations\\nthat may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine. For an informal example, a squad\\nleader checks with the squad to the right to make sure the squads’ fields of fire overlap. For a formal example,\\na corps action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, leaders\\nalways coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present \\nit to the decision maker.\\nIDENTIFY THE PROBLEM \\n3-26.

They provide advice on Army capabilities and resources, force and resource posturing, and \\nthe conduct of operations from a land perspective. In addition, the theater  army develops a \\ntheater support plan to the CCP.

(See FM 3-94 and \\nATP 3-93 for a detailed discussion of the roles, responsibilities, and organization of theater \\narmies.) \\nContingency Plans \\n2-31. A key aspect of combatant command planning is the development of contingency plans. A contingency\\nplan is a branch of a campaign plan that is planned based on hypothetical situations for designated threats,\\ncatastrophic events, and contingent missions outside of crisis conditions (JP 5- 0). Contingency plans are\\nbranches to global, regional, functional, and combatant campaign plans that address potential threats that put\\none or more national interests at risk in ways that warrant military operations. Contingency plans are built to\\naccount for the possibility that campaign activities could fail to prevent aggression, fail to preclude large\\nscale instability in a key state or region, or fail to adequately respond to a natural disaster. The UCP, CPG,\\nand JSCP assign CCDRs responsibilities for developing specific contingency plans. CCDRs also develop\\ncontingency plans to their CCPs based on theater estimates.\\n2-32. Contingency plans address an anticipated crisis, and they must be modified during execution to respond \\nto conditions at the time of execution. If an approved contingency plan exists that closely resembles the\\nemerging scenario, that plan can be refined or adapted as necessary and executed. Contingency plans are\\noften phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable\\nto the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termina tion criteria. They\\naddress military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n2-33.

The staff nominates information requirements to the\\ncommander that become CCIRs and EEFIs.

The CCIRs\\nare the primary focus for information collection activities.\\nDevelop the Initial Information Collection Plan \\nG-42. The initial information collection plan is crucial to begin or adjust the collection effort to help answer\\ninformation requirements necessary to develop effective plans. The initial information collection plan sets\\ninformation collection in motion. Staffs may issue it as part of a WARNORD, a fragmentary order\\n(F\\nRAGORD), or an OPORD. As more information becomes available, staffs incorporate it into a complete\\ninformation plan to the OPORD.\\nG-43. At this point in the MDMP, the initial information plan is somewhat generic because the staff members\\nmust still develop friendly COAs. The basis for the plan is the commander ’s initial information collection\\nguidance, the primary information gaps identified by the staff during mission analysis, and the enemy\\nsituational template developed during IPOE.\\nG-44. The intelligence staff creates the collection management tools (including the information collection\\nmatrix, information collection synchronization matrix, and information collection overlay) for the\\ninformation collection plan. The operations staff is res ponsible for the information collection plan. In\\ndeveloping the plan, the operations staff considers—\\n• Requirements for collection assets in subsequent missions.\\n• The time available to develop and refine the initial information collection plan.\\n• The risk the commander is willing to accept if information collection missions begin before the\\ninformation collection plan is fully integrated into the scheme of maneuver.\\n• Insertion and extraction methods for reconnaissance, security, surveillance, and intelligence units.\\n• Contingencies for inclement weather to ensure coverage of key NAIs or TAIs.\\n• The communications plan for transmission of reports from assets to tactical command posts (CPs).\\n• The inclusion of collection asset locations and movements into the fire support plan.\\n• The reconnaissance handover with higher or subordinate echelons.\\n• The sustainment support.\\n• Legal support requirements.\\nIssue</td>\n",

The levels of warfare distinguish four broad overlapping activities: providing national direction and\\ncreating national strategy (national strategic), conducting continuous theater campaigning (theater strategic);\\nplanning and conducting campaigns and major operations (operational); or planning and executing\\noperations, battles, engagements, and actions (tactical). Different commanders act at more than one level of\\nwar, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates\\nt\\nheater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campai gn\\nde\\nsign and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without\\nfinite limits or boundaries. They do, however, c orrelate to specific activities and responsibilities. They help\\ncommanders visualize the relationships and actions required to link strategic objectives, military operations\\nat various echelons, and tactical actions. Among the levels of warfare, planning horizons, methods, and\\nproducts differ greatly. Without this context, tactical operations become disconnected from operational end\\nstates and strategic objectives. There are skills and practices related to strategic, theater strategic, operational,\\nand tactical level that differ from each other and are enhanced by specific training and education.\\nNATIONAL STRATEGIC LEVEL \\n2-5.

Success during operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgement to\\navailable information and knowledge. As such, commanders and staffs seek to build and maintain situational\\nunderstanding throughout the operations process. Situational understanding is product of applying analysis\\nand judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission\\nvariables.\\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\nA-2. An operational environment (OE) is the aggregate of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that\\naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. For Army forces, an OE\\nincludes portions of the land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains understood through three\\ndimensions (human, information, and physical). The land, maritime, air, and space domains are defined by\\nt\\nheir physical areas. The cyberspace domain, a man -made network of networks, transits and connects  the\\not\\nher domains through the electromagnetic spectrum. (See FM 3-0 for a more detailed discussion of an OE.)\\nA-3. Understanding an OE forms the basis for decision making during planning, preparation, execution, and\\nassessment of an operation.

When problems are difficult to identify, the operation’s end state is unclear, or a course of action (COA)\\nis not self-evident, commanders employ ADM. This is often the case when developing long- range plans for\\nextended operations. ADM is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them. ADM is particularly useful as an aid to\\nconceptual planning, but it must be integrated with the detailed planning typically associated with the MDMP\\nto produce executable plans and orders. ADM may be conducted before, concurrent with, or after the MDMP. \\nThere is no one way or prescribed set of steps to employ the ADM. There are, however, several activities\\nassociated with ADM including—\\n• Framing an OE.\\n• Framing problems.\\n• Developing an operational approach.\\n• Reframing (as required).\\n1-55. While planners complete some activities before others, the understanding and learning within one\\nactivity may require revisiting the learning from another activity. Based on their understanding and learning\\ngained during ADM, commanders issue planning guidance—including an operational approach—to guide\\nmore detailed planning using the MDMP. (See Chapter 4 for information on employing ADM.)\\nTHE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n1-56. The MDMP is an iterative planning methodology used to understand the problem or problems,\\nunderstand the situation and mission, develop COAs, decide on a COA, and produce an OPLAN or order. It\\nis an orderly, analytical process that integrates the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate\\nheadquarters in the development of a plan or order. The MDMP helps leaders apply thoroughness, clarity,\\nsound judgement, logic, and professional knowledge to develop situational understanding and produce a plan\\nor order that accomplishes the mission.\\nNote. Depending on the situation, including the time available for planning, commanders may \\ninitiate the MDMP without the benefits of conducting ADM</td>\n",

The commander personally leads the conceptual component of planning. While commanders are\\nengaged in parts of detailed planning, they leave most specifics to staff officers. Conceptual planning\\nprovides the basis for subsequent planning. The commander’ s intent and operational approach provide the\\nframework for the entire plan. This framework leads to a concept of operations and associated schemes of\\nsupport, such as schemes of maneuver, intelligence, fires, protection, engineer operations, information, and\\ns\\nustainment. In turn, the schemes of support lead to the specifics of execution, including tasks to subordinate\\nunits and attachments (including annexes, appendices, tabs, and exhibits) to the base OPLAN or OPORD.\\nHowever, this dynamic does not operate in only one direction. Conceptual planning must respond to detailed\\nconstraints. For example, the realities of a deployment schedule (a detailed concern) influence the operational \\napproach (a conceptual concern).\\n1-52. Planning requires the integration of both conceptual thinking and detailed analysis. Army leaders\\nemploy several methodologies for planning, determining the appropriate mix based on the scope and\\nunderstanding of the problem, time available, and availability of a staff. Army planning methodologies\\ninclude—\\n• Army problem solving.\\n• Army design methodology (ADM).\\n• The military decision-making process (MDMP).\\n• Rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP).\\n• Troop leading procedures (TLP).\\nARMY PROBLEM SOLVING \\n1-53. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for Army leaders. Army\\nproblem solving forms the base logic of other planning methodologies. Where other methodologies are\\ndesigned for planning operations, Army problem solving is a methodology available for leaders to use to\\ni\\ndentify and solve a variety of problems both in garrison and in operations. Army problem solving is an\\nanalytical approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the\\nbest solution, developing a plan, and implementing that plan to solve the problem. The steps to Army problem \\nsolving are—\\n\\nChapter 1 \\n10 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n• Step 1 - Gather information.\\n•</td>\n",

When the unit receives a new mission or a planning requirement is identified, the staff is alerted and\\nbegins necessary preparation. There are times when staff members will need to alert the commander to an\\norder. When the commander is alerted, staffs often conduct a backbrief to the commander to share\\n\\nThe Military Decision-Making Process \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 81 \\nunderstanding and enable the commander to more quickly develop a visualization. Unit standard operating \\nprocedures (SOPs) should establish notification procedures and identify standard planning teams based on \\nthe anticipated planning effort. A planning team normally consists of a lead planner from the G -5, G-3, or \\nS-3 sections and representatives from each warfighting function. Additional staff members by area of\\nexpertise, liaison officers, and unified action partners are added to the team as required. When trying to plan\\ncollaboratively, those organizations or subordinate units must be notified to ensure the right personnel are\\nidentified to support the planning effort. Typically, for new missions or large planning efforts, the planning\\nteam may consist of representatives from all staff sections and unit liaison officers.

Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example,\\nmay contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs,\\nor in policy memoranda.

Constraints could also be based on resource limitations in the command, information release\\nrestrictions, or legal constraints. Resource limitations may include the number of capabilities provided or the\\navailability of collection capabilities to support a n operation.

Both types of joint plans have four levels of details: commander ’s estimate, base plan, co ncept\\nplan, and OPLAN.\\nD-4. An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of\\noperations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time -phased force and deployment list (JP 5- 0). An\\nOPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be\\ndeveloped for a single part or phase of a long- term operation. An OPLAN becomes an operation order\\n(OPORD) when the commander sets an execution time or designates an event that triggers the operation.\\nD-5. A supporting plan is an operation plan prepared by a supporting commander, a subordinate\\ncommander, or an agency to satisfy the requests or requirements of the supported commander’s plan (JP 5-0).\\nF\\nor example, an ARFOR commander develops a supporting plan for how Army forces will support the joint\\nforce commander’s campaign plan or OPLAN.\\nAppendix D \\n198 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nD-6. A branch is the contingency options built into the base plan. A branch is used for changing the mission,\\norientation, or direction of movement of a force to aid success of the operation based on anticipated events,\\nopportunities, or disruptions caused by enemy actions and reactions. Branches add flexibility to plans by\\nanticipating situations that could alter the basic plan or order.\\nD-7. A sequel is the subsequent major operation or phase based on the possible outcomes of the current\\nmajor operation or phase. For every action or major operation that does not accomplish a strategic or\\noperational objective, there should be a sequel for each possible outcome, such as win, lose, draw, or decisive\\nwin.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS \\nD-8.

Planning keeps the force oriented on future objectives despite the requirements of current operations.\\nPlanning is essential for seizing and retaining the initiative by allowing commanders and staffs to consider\\npotential decisions and actions in advance. Planning reduces the time between decisions and actions during\\nexecution, especially at higher echelons. While some actions are implemented immediately, others require\\nforethought and preparation. For example, changing the direction of attack may be a relatively simple and\\nimmediate matter for a battalion; however, changing the scheme of maneuver for a division, including all its\\nsupport, is complicated and time consuming. Changing the priority of fires at division level may take\\nconsiderable time if artillery units must reposition. If leaders wait until an event occurs to begin planning and\\npreparing for a response, units may not be able to react quickly enough, ceding the initiative to enemy forces.\\n1-45. During execution planners continue to develop or refine options for potential enemy action and friendly \\nopportunities. By anticipating potential events and transitions beforehand, planning promotes flexibility a nd\\nr\\napid decision making during execution. As  a result, the force anticipates events and acts purposefully and\\neffectively before the enemy can act or before situations deteriorate.

A decision point is a point in space and the latest time when the commander or staff anticipates making\\na key decision concerning a specific course of action ( JP 5-0).

While an operational approach is broad, it describes the commander’s visualization in time, space, and\\npurpose. It also addresses resources required to support the operational approach and accounts for risk. After\\nforming a framework for the operational approach using lines of operations and lines of effort, commanders\\nand planning teams consider additional elements of operational art to refine the operational approach.\\nAdditional elements of operational art to consider include—\\n• Operational reach, basing, and culmination.\\n• Tempo.\\n• Phasing and transitions.\\n• Risk.\\nOperational Reach, Basing, and Culmination \\n4-81. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ its\\ncapabilities. The skillful positioning of forces, reserves, bases, and equipment extend operational reach.\\nAlthough reach might be constrained or limited by the geography, enemy forces, and adversaries in and\\naround an operational area, reach is extended by—\\n• Forward positioning of capabilities and resources.\\n• Increasing the range and effectiveness of weapons systems.\\n• Leveraging host-nation support and contract support.\\n4-82. Basing, in the broadest sense, is an indispensable part of operational art. It is tied to lines of operations,\\nand it affects operational reach. In particular, the arrangement and positioning of bases in an operational area\\nunderwrites the ability of the force to protect its components from enemy action while expanding the distance \\nand duration of its capabilities. Commanders consider bases and base camps as intermediate staging bases,\\nlodgments (subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases as\\npart of the operational approach.\\n4-83. Commanders consider culmination when developing their operational approach and visualizi ng\\nr\\nesources to support it. Culmination is that point in time and space at which a force no longer possesses the\\ncapability to continue its current form of operations. Culmination means a shift in relative combat power. It\\nis relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare. While conducting offensive tasks, th e\\nc\\nulminating point occurs when the force cannot continue the attack, and it assumes a defensive posture or\\nexecutes an operational pause.

Assessment information requirements compete with other information\\nrequirements for resources. When an information requirement is not resourced, staffs cannot collect the\\nassociated indicator and must remove it from the plan. Staffs then adjust the assessment framework to ensure\\nthat the MOE or MOP is properly worded.\\nSTEP 5 - ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS AND GENERATING\\nRECOMMENDATIONS \\n8-31.  In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, commanders assign staff members to analyze\\nassessment data and develop recommendations. For example, the intelligence officer leads the assessment of\\nenemy forces. The engineer officer leads the effort on assessing infrastructure and development. The civil\\naffairs operations officer leads assessment concerning the progress of local and provincial governments. The\\nchief of staff (COS ) aggressively requires staff principals and subject matter experts to participate in\\nprocessing the formal assessment and in generating smart, actionable recommendations. The operations\\nresearch and analysis officer assists the commander and staff with developing both assessment frameworks\\nand the command’s assessment process.\\nSTEP 6 - IDENTIFY FEEDBACK MECHANISM \\n8-32. A formal assessment with meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate\\ndecision maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, when, where, and why\\nof that presentation. The commander and staff also discuss feedback leading up to and following that\\npresentation.

For Army forces, operational art seeks to ensure that commanders employ forces, material, and time\\neffectively to achieve objectives. It requires a broad vision, the ability to anticipate, a careful understanding\\nof means to ends, and an understanding of inherent risk. Always within the context of a higher echelon joint\\nplan or order, using operational art helps Army commanders and staffs understand, visualize, and describe\\noperations, as shown in figure 2-4 on page 39.\\nPlanning and Operational Art \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 39 \\nFigure 2-4. Operational art \\n2-48. Operational art helps commanders to determine when, where, and for what purpose to employ forces\\nand to determine the sequence of those forces in major operations and battles. It requires commanders and\\nstaffs to answer these questions:\\n• What conditions, when established, constitute the desired end state (ends)?\\n• How will the force achieve these desired conditions (ways)?\\n• What sequence of actions helps attain these conditions (ways)?\\n• What resources are required to accomplish that sequence of actions (means)?\\n• What is the chance of failure or unacceptable consequences in performing that sequence of actions\\n(risk)?\\n2-49. Both ADM (described in Chapter 4) and the MDMP (described in Chapter 5) are tools used by Army\\ncommanders and their staffs in the application of operational art. ADM supports operational art as a\\nmethodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe problems and\\napproaches to solving them. ADM is associated with conceptual planning that helps commanders and staffs\\nframe an OE, frame ill-defined problems, and develop an operational approach to resolve identified problems.\\nThe understanding gained by both the process and specific outputs of ADM inform the more detailed\\nplanning conducted during the MDMP.\\n2-50. A key output of ADM is an operational approach. It is a broad description of the mission, operational\\nconcepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish the mission. The operational approach provides the\\nframework for operations, serves as the basis for detailed planning, and facilitates unity of purpose across the\\nforce. Operational art never occurs in a vacuum.</td>\n",

The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power —the total means of destructive\\nand disruptive force that a military unit/formation can apply against an enemy at a given time (JP 3 -0).\\nD\\nesignating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and\\npriorities to the main effort as circumstances require.

Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets necessary to accomplish the\\nmission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort\\nin an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the\\ncurrent tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when\\npositioning their reserve.

Planners conduct a troop-to-task analysis to determine \\nthe type of units and capabilities needed to accomplish these tasks.\\n5-100. Planners proceed to initially array friendly forces on the sketch, starting with the forces executing the\\nessential task and planning backwards in time, continuing with those units executing supporting tasks and\\nreserve requirements. The initial array focu ses on generic ground maneuver units without regard to specific\\ntype or task organization, and then planners consider all appropriate intangible factors. Planners array ground\\nforces two levels below their echelon. For example, at division level, planners array generic battalions.\\nDuring this step, planners do not assign missions to specific units; they only consider which forces are\\nnecessary to accomplish their task.\\nChapter 5 \\n102 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n5-101. The initial array identifies the total number of units needed, including the reserve, and it identifies\\npossible methods of dealing with enemy forces and stability tasks. If the number of units arrayed is less than\\nthe number available, planners place additional units in a pool for use when they develop the initial concept\\nof operations. If the number of units arrayed exceeds the number available, and the difference cannot be\\ncompensated for with intangible factors, the staff determines whether the COA is f easible or not. Ways to\\nmake up shortfalls include requesting additional resources, accepting risk in that portion of the assigned area,\\nha\\nving units execute multiple tasks, or executing tasks required for the COA sequentially rather than\\nsimultaneously.\\nDevelop the Concept of Operations \\n5-102. Once forces are arrayed, the staff develops a concept of operations for each COA. The concept of\\noperations describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the mission within the commander ’s intent. I t\\nco\\nncisely expresses the “how” of the commander’s visualization and governs the design of supporting plans\\nor annexes. The concept of operations summarizes the contributions of all warfighting functions, ensures the\\nholistic application of combat power, and links together the various efforts of subordinate units into a\\ncohesive operation.\\n5-103.

Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. \\nTime, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The\\ncommander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum\\ntime for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of\\ntwo-thirds of available time for subordinate units to conduct their planning and preparation. This leaves\\none-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the\\nother two -thirds for their own preparation. Commanders should c onsider when an order is issued to\\nsubordinate units. For example, an order transmitted at 0300 to meet the one -third, two-thirds rule may not\\ngive subordinate units adequate time to effectively plan.\\n5-23. Commanders and staffs also consider their higher echelon headquarters ’ timeline, their operational\\ntimeline, their planning timeline, anticipated enemy timelines, light and weather, and other essential factors.\\nA useful technique to help the commander and staff visualize the relationships and synchronization between\\nthese timelines is to build a higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data  timeline (also\\nknown as a HOPE[W/L] timeline).

If the process can continue without making a particular assumption, the assumption is unnecessary and\\nnot used. So long as an assumption is both valid and necessary, leaders treat it as a fact. Leaders continually\\nseek to confirm or deny the validity of their assumptions. The confirmation or denial of an assumption ma y\\nr\\nequire the problem and plan to be reassessed.\\nOpinions \\n3-24. When gathering information, leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment\\nthat the leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result\\nof years of experience. Leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts,\\ninclude them as opinions, or reject them.\\nOrganizing Information \\n3-25. Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the\\nproblem or its solution. Leaders determine these requirements as they gather information. They coordinate\\nwith other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations\\nthat may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine. For an informal example, a squad\\nleader checks with the squad to the right to make sure the squads’ fields of fire overlap. For a formal example,\\na corps action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, leaders\\nalways coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present \\nit to the decision maker.\\nIDENTIFY THE PROBLEM \\n3-26. The next step in problem solving is recognizing and defining a problem. This step is crucial, as the\\nproblem may not be obvious. Therefore, leaders determine what the problem is by clearly defining its scope\\nArmy Problem Solving \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 51 \\nand limitations. Leaders should allow sufficient time and resources to clearly define the problem before \\nmoving on to other steps in the process. \\n3-27.

A key aspect of combatant command planning is the development of contingency plans. A contingency\\nplan is a branch of a campaign plan that is planned based on hypothetical situations for designated threats,\\ncatastrophic events, and contingent missions outside of crisis conditions (JP 5- 0). Contingency plans are\\nbranches to global, regional, functional, and combatant campaign plans that address potential threats that put\\none or more national interests at risk in ways that warrant military operations. Contingency plans are built to\\naccount for the possibility that campaign activities could fail to prevent aggression, fail to preclude large\\nscale instability in a key state or region, or fail to adequately respond to a natural disaster. The UCP, CPG,\\nand JSCP assign CCDRs responsibilities for developing specific contingency plans. CCDRs also develop\\ncontingency plans to their CCPs based on theater estimates.\\n2-32. Contingency plans address an anticipated crisis, and they must be modified during execution to respond \\nto conditions at the time of execution. If an approved contingency plan exists that closely resembles the\\nemerging scenario, that plan can be refined or adapted as necessary and executed. Contingency plans are\\noften phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable\\nto the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termina tion criteria. They\\naddress military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n2-33.

The levels of warfare distinguish four broad overlapping activities: providing national direction and\\ncreating national strategy (national strategic), conducting continuous theater campaigning (theater strategic);\\nplanning and conducting campaigns and major operations (operational); or planning and executing\\noperations, battles, engagements, and actions (tactical). Different commanders act at more than one level of\\nwar, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates\\nt\\nheater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campai gn\\nde\\nsign and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without\\nfinite limits or boundaries. They do, however, c orrelate to specific activities and responsibilities. They help\\ncommanders visualize the relationships and actions required to link strategic objectives, military operations\\nat various echelons, and tactical actions. Among the levels of warfare, planning horizons, methods, and\\nproducts differ greatly.

Success during operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgement to\\navailable information and knowledge. As such, commanders and staffs seek to build and maintain situational\\nunderstanding throughout the operations process. Situational understanding is product of applying analysis\\nand judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission\\nvariables.\\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\nA-2. An operational environment (OE) is the aggregate of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that\\naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. For Army forces, an OE\\nincludes portions of the land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains understood through three\\ndimensions (human, information, and physical). The land, maritime, air, and space domains are defined by\\nt\\nheir physical areas. The cyberspace domain, a man -made network of networks, transits and connects  the\\not\\nher domains through the electromagnetic spectrum. (See FM 3-0 for a more detailed discussion of an OE.)\\nA-3. Understanding an OE forms the basis for decision making during planning, preparation, execution, and\\nassessment of an operation.

When problems are difficult to identify, the operation’s end state is unclear, or a course of action (COA)\\nis not self-evident, commanders employ ADM. This is often the case when developing long- range plans for\\nextended operations. ADM is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them. ADM is particularly useful as an aid to\\nconceptual planning, but it must be integrated with the detailed planning typically associated with the MDMP\\nto produce executable plans and orders. ADM may be conducted before, concurrent with, or after the MDMP. \\nThere is no one way or prescribed set of steps to employ the ADM. There are, however, several activities\\nassociated with ADM including—\\n• Framing an OE.\\n• Framing problems.\\n• Developing an operational approach.\\n• Reframing (as required).\\n1-55. While planners complete some activities before others, the understanding and learning within one\\nactivity may require revisiting the learning from another activity. Based on their understanding and learning\\ngained during ADM, commanders issue planning guidance—including an operational approach—to guide\\nmore detailed planning using the MDMP. (See Chapter 4 for information on employing ADM.)\\nTHE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n1-56. The MDMP is an iterative planning methodology used to understand the problem or problems,\\nunderstand the situation and mission, develop COAs, decide on a COA, and produce an OPLAN or order. It\\nis an orderly, analytical process that integrates the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate\\nheadquarters in the development of a plan or order. The MDMP helps leaders apply thoroughness, clarity,\\nsound judgement, logic, and professional knowledge to develop situational understanding and produce a plan\\nor order that accomplishes the mission.\\nNote. Depending on the situation, including the time available for planning, commanders may \\ninitiate the MDMP without the benefits of conducting ADM</td>\n",

The commander personally leads the conceptual component of planning. While commanders are\\nengaged in parts of detailed planning, they leave most specifics to staff officers. Conceptual planning\\nprovides the basis for subsequent planning. The commander’ s intent and operational approach provide the\\nframework for the entire plan. This framework leads to a concept of operations and associated schemes of\\nsupport, such as schemes of maneuver, intelligence, fires, protection, engineer operations, information, and\\ns\\nustainment. In turn, the schemes of support lead to the specifics of execution, including tasks to subordinate\\nunits and attachments (including annexes, appendices, tabs, and exhibits) to the base OPLAN or OPORD.\\nHowever, this dynamic does not operate in only one direction. Conceptual planning must respond to detailed\\nconstraints. For example, the realities of a deployment schedule (a detailed concern) influence the operational \\napproach (a conceptual concern).\\n1-52. Planning requires the integration of both conceptual thinking and detailed analysis. Army leaders\\nemploy several methodologies for planning, determining the appropriate mix based on the scope and\\nunderstanding of the problem, time available, and availability of a staff. Army planning methodologies\\ninclude—\\n• Army problem solving.\\n• Army design methodology (ADM).\\n• The military decision-making process (MDMP).\\n• Rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP).\\n• Troop leading procedures (TLP).\\nARMY PROBLEM SOLVING \\n1-53. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for Army leaders. Army\\nproblem solving forms the base logic of other planning methodologies. Where other methodologies are\\ndesigned for planning operations, Army problem solving is a methodology available for leaders to use to\\ni\\ndentify and solve a variety of problems both in garrison and in operations. Army problem solving is an\\nanalytical approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the\\nbest solution, developing a plan, and implementing that plan to solve the problem. The steps to Army problem \\nsolving are—\\n\\nChapter 1 \\n10 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n• Step 1 - Gather information.\\n•</td>\n",

When the unit receives a new mission or a planning requirement is identified, the staff is alerted and\\nbegins necessary preparation.

Both types of joint plans have four levels of details: commander ’s estimate, base plan, co ncept\\nplan, and OPLAN.\\nD-4. An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of\\noperations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time -phased force and deployment list (JP 5- 0). An\\nOPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be\\ndeveloped for a single part or phase of a long- term operation. An OPLAN becomes an operation order\\n(OPORD) when the commander sets an execution time or designates an event that triggers the operation.\\nD-5. A supporting plan is an operation plan prepared by a supporting commander, a subordinate\\ncommander, or an agency to satisfy the requests or requirements of the supported commander’s plan (JP 5-0).\\nF\\nor example, an ARFOR commander develops a supporting plan for how Army forces will support the joint\\nforce commander’s campaign plan or OPLAN.\\nAppendix D \\n198 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nD-6. A branch is the contingency options built into the base plan. A branch is used for changing the mission,\\norientation, or direction of movement of a force to aid success of the operation based on anticipated events,\\nopportunities, or disruptions caused by enemy actions and reactions. Branches add flexibility to plans by\\nanticipating situations that could alter the basic plan or order.\\nD-7. A sequel is the subsequent major operation or phase based on the possible outcomes of the current\\nmajor operation or phase. For every action or major operation that does not accomplish a strategic or\\noperational objective, there should be a sequel for each possible outcome, such as win, lose, draw, or decisive\\nwin.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS \\nD-8.

Planning keeps the force oriented on future objectives despite the requirements of current operations.\\nPlanning is essential for seizing and retaining the initiative by allowing commanders and staffs to consider\\npotential decisions and actions in advance. Planning reduces the time between decisions and actions during\\nexecution, especially at higher echelons. While some actions are implemented immediately, others require\\nforethought and preparation. For example, changing the direction of attack may be a relatively simple and\\nimmediate matter for a battalion; however, changing the scheme of maneuver for a division, including all its\\nsupport, is complicated and time consuming. Changing the priority of fires at division level may take\\nconsiderable time if artillery units must reposition. If leaders wait until an event occurs to begin planning and\\npreparing for a response, units may not be able to react quickly enough, ceding the initiative to enemy forces.\\n1-45. During execution planners continue to develop or refine options for potential enemy action and friendly \\nopportunities. By anticipating potential events and transitions beforehand, planning promotes flexibility a nd\\nr\\napid decision making during execution. As  a result, the force anticipates events and acts purposefully and\\neffectively before the enemy can act or before situations deteriorate. Several tools are available to the\\ncommander and planners to assist in adapting to changing circumstances. These tools include —\\n• Decision points.\\n• Branches.\\n• Sequels.\\n1-46. A decision point is a point in space and the latest time when the commander or staff anticipates making\\na key decision concerning a specific course of action ( JP 5-0). A decision point is associated to actions by\\nthe enemy, the friendly force, or the population, and it is tied to a commander ’s critical information\\nrequirement (CCIR). Examples of friendly actions associated with a decision point range from a single tas k\\nt\\no a subordinate unit to the force as a whole in executing a branch or sequel.

While an operational approach is broad, it describes the commander’s visualization in time, space, and\\npurpose. It also addresses resources required to support the operational approach and accounts for risk. After\\nforming a framework for the operational approach using lines of operations and lines of effort, commanders\\nand planning teams consider additional elements of operational art to refine the operational approach.\\nAdditional elements of operational art to consider include—\\n• Operational reach, basing, and culmination.\\n• Tempo.\\n• Phasing and transitions.\\n• Risk.\\nOperational Reach, Basing, and Culmination \\n4-81. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ its\\ncapabilities. The skillful positioning of forces, reserves, bases, and equipment extend operational reach.\\nAlthough reach might be constrained or limited by the geography, enemy forces, and adversaries in and\\naround an operational area, reach is extended by—\\n• Forward positioning of capabilities and resources.\\n• Increasing the range and effectiveness of weapons systems.\\n• Leveraging host-nation support and contract support.\\n4-82. Basing, in the broadest sense, is an indispensable part of operational art. It is tied to lines of operations,\\nand it affects operational reach. In particular, the arrangement and positioning of bases in an operational area\\nunderwrites the ability of the force to protect its components from enemy action while expanding the distance \\nand duration of its capabilities. Commanders consider bases and base camps as intermediate staging bases,\\nlodgments (subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases as\\npart of the operational approach.\\n4-83. Commanders consider culmination when developing their operational approach and visualizi ng\\nr\\nesources to support it. Culmination is that point in time and space at which a force no longer possesses the\\ncapability to continue its current form of operations. Culmination means a shift in relative combat power. It\\nis relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare. While conducting offensive tasks, th e\\nc\\nulminating point occurs when the force cannot continue the attack, and it assumes a defensive posture or\\nexecutes an operational pause.

Assessment information requirements compete with other information\\nrequirements for resources. When an information requirement is not resourced, staffs cannot collect the\\nassociated indicator and must remove it from the plan. Staffs then adjust the assessment framework to ensure\\nthat the MOE or MOP is properly worded.\\nSTEP 5 - ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS AND GENERATING\\nRECOMMENDATIONS \\n8-31.  In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, commanders assign staff members to analyze\\nassessment data and develop recommendations. For example, the intelligence officer leads the assessment of\\nenemy forces. The engineer officer leads the effort on assessing infrastructure and development. The civil\\naffairs operations officer leads assessment concerning the progress of local and provincial governments. The\\nchief of staff (COS ) aggressively requires staff principals and subject matter experts to participate in\\nprocessing the formal assessment and in generating smart, actionable recommendations. The operations\\nresearch and analysis officer assists the commander and staff with developing both assessment frameworks\\nand the command’s assessment process.\\nSTEP 6 - IDENTIFY FEEDBACK MECHANISM \\n8-32. A formal assessment with meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate\\ndecision maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, when, where, and why\\nof that presentation. The commander and staff also discuss feedback leading up to and following that\\npresentation. Feedback might include which assessment working groups the commander requires and how to\\nact on and follow up on recommendations.\\nASSESSMENT WITHIN THE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n8-33.

For Army forces, operational art seeks to ensure that commanders employ forces, material, and time\\neffectively to achieve objectives. It requires a broad vision, the ability to anticipate, a careful understanding\\nof means to ends, and an understanding of inherent risk. Always within the context of a higher echelon joint\\nplan or order, using operational art helps Army commanders and staffs understand, visualize, and describe\\noperations, as shown in figure 2-4 on page 39.\\nPlanning and Operational Art \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 39 \\nFigure 2-4. Operational art \\n2-48. Operational art helps commanders to determine when, where, and for what purpose to employ forces\\nand to determine the sequence of those forces in major operations and battles. It requires commanders and\\nstaffs to answer these questions:\\n• What conditions, when established, constitute the desired end state (ends)?\\n• How will the force achieve these desired conditions (ways)?\\n• What sequence of actions helps attain these conditions (ways)?\\n• What resources are required to accomplish that sequence of actions (means)?\\n• What is the chance of failure or unacceptable consequences in performing that sequence of actions\\n(risk)?\\n2-49. Both ADM (described in Chapter 4) and the MDMP (described in Chapter 5) are tools used by Army\\ncommanders and their staffs in the application of operational art. ADM supports operational art as a\\nmethodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe problems and\\napproaches to solving them. ADM is associated with conceptual planning that helps commanders and staffs\\nframe an OE, frame ill-defined problems, and develop an operational approach to resolve identified problems.\\nThe understanding gained by both the process and specific outputs of ADM inform the more detailed\\nplanning conducted during the MDMP.\\n2-50. A key output of ADM is an operational approach. It is a broad description of the mission, operational\\nconcepts, tasks, and actions required to accomplish the mission. The operational approach provides the\\nframework for operations, serves as the basis for detailed planning, and facilitates unity of purpose across the\\nforce. Operational art never occurs in a vacuum.</td>\n",

A reserve  is that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from\\naction at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3 -90).\\n1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power —the total means of destructive\\nand disruptive force that a military unit/formation can apply against an enemy at a given time (JP 3 -0).\\nD\\nesignating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and\\npriorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times\\nduring an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success  at the time.\\n1-40. Commanders resource supporting efforts with the minimum assets necessary to accomplish the\\nmission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort\\nin an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the\\ncurrent tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when\\npositioning their reserve. While commanders can assign their reserve a wide variety of tasks, throu gh\\npl\\nanning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n1-42.

Planners conduct a troop-to-task analysis to determine \\nthe type of units and capabilities needed to accomplish these tasks.\\n5-100. Planners proceed to initially array friendly forces on the sketch, starting with the forces executing the\\nessential task and planning backwards in time, continuing with those units executing supporting tasks and\\nreserve requirements. The initial array focu ses on generic ground maneuver units without regard to specific\\ntype or task organization, and then planners consider all appropriate intangible factors. Planners array ground\\nforces two levels below their echelon. For example, at division level, planners array generic battalions.\\nDuring this step, planners do not assign missions to specific units; they only consider which forces are\\nnecessary to accomplish their task.\\nChapter 5 \\n102 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n5-101. The initial array identifies the total number of units needed, including the reserve, and it identifies\\npossible methods of dealing with enemy forces and stability tasks. If the number of units arrayed is less than\\nthe number available, planners place additional units in a pool for use when they develop the initial concept\\nof operations. If the number of units arrayed exceeds the number available, and the difference cannot be\\ncompensated for with intangible factors, the staff determines whether the COA is f easible or not. Ways to\\nmake up shortfalls include requesting additional resources, accepting risk in that portion of the assigned area,\\nha\\nving units execute multiple tasks, or executing tasks required for the COA sequentially rather than\\nsimultaneously.\\nDevelop the Concept of Operations \\n5-102. Once forces are arrayed, the staff develops a concept of operations for each COA. The concept of\\noperations describes how arrayed forces will accomplish the mission within the commander ’s intent. I t\\nco\\nncisely expresses the “how” of the commander’s visualization and governs the design of supporting plans\\nor annexes.

The why  provides the mission’ s purpose—the reason the\\nunit is to perform the task and how it is intended to contribute to the higher echelon headquarters’ success.

Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. \\nTime, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The\\ncommander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum\\ntime for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of\\ntwo-thirds of available time for subordinate units to conduct their planning and preparation. This leaves\\none-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the\\nother two -thirds for their own preparation. Commanders should c onsider when an order is issued to\\nsubordinate units. For example, an order transmitted at 0300 to meet the one -third, two-thirds rule may not\\ngive subordinate units adequate time to effectively plan.\\n5-23. Commanders and staffs also consider their higher echelon headquarters ’ timeline, their operational\\ntimeline, their planning timeline, anticipated enemy timelines, light and weather, and other essential factors.\\nA useful technique to help the commander and staff visualize the relationships and synchronization between\\nthese timelines is to build a higher, operational, planning, enemy, and weather and light data  timeline (also\\nknown as a HOPE[W/L] timeline).

The confirmation or denial of an assumption ma y\\nr\\nequire the problem and plan to be reassessed.\\nOpinions \\n3-24. When gathering information, leaders evaluate opinions carefully. An opinion is a personal judgment\\nthat the leader or another individual makes. Opinions cannot be totally discounted. They are often the result\\nof years of experience. Leaders objectively evaluate opinions to determine whether to accept them as facts,\\ninclude them as opinions, or reject them.\\nOrganizing Information \\n3-25. Organizing information includes coordination with units and agencies that may be affected by the\\nproblem or its solution. Leaders determine these requirements as they gather information. They coordinate\\nwith other leaders as they solve problems, both to obtain assistance and to keep others informed of situations\\nthat may affect them. Such coordination may be informal and routine. For an informal example, a squad\\nleader checks with the squad to the right to make sure the squads’ fields of fire overlap. For a formal example,\\na corps action officer staffs a decision paper with the major subordinate commands. As a minimum, leaders\\nalways coordinate with units or agencies that might be affected by a solution they propose before they present \\nit to the decision maker.\\nIDENTIFY THE PROBLEM \\n3-26. The next step in problem solving is recognizing and defining a problem. This step is crucial, as the\\nproblem may not be obvious. Therefore, leaders determine what the problem is by clearly defining its scope\\nArmy Problem Solving \\n04 November 2024 FM 5-0 51 \\nand limitations. Leaders should allow sufficient time and resources to clearly define the problem before \\nmoving on to other steps in the process. \\n3-27. A problem exists when the current state or condition differs from or impedes achieving the desired end\\nstate or condition. Leaders identify problems from a variety of</td>\n",

A key aspect of combatant command planning is the development of contingency plans. A contingency\\nplan is a branch of a campaign plan that is planned based on hypothetical situations for designated threats,\\ncatastrophic events, and contingent missions outside of crisis conditions (JP 5- 0). Contingency plans are\\nbranches to global, regional, functional, and combatant campaign plans that address potential threats that put\\none or more national interests at risk in ways that warrant military operations. Contingency plans are built to\\naccount for the possibility that campaign activities could fail to prevent aggression, fail to preclude large\\nscale instability in a key state or region, or fail to adequately respond to a natural disaster. The UCP, CPG,\\nand JSCP assign CCDRs responsibilities for developing specific contingency plans. CCDRs also develop\\ncontingency plans to their CCPs based on theater estimates.\\n2-32. Contingency plans address an anticipated crisis, and they must be modified during execution to respond \\nto conditions at the time of execution. If an approved contingency plan exists that closely resembles the\\nemerging scenario, that plan can be refined or adapted as necessary and executed. Contingency plans are\\noften phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable\\nto the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termina tion criteria. They\\naddress military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n2-33.

At this point in the MDMP, the initial information plan is somewhat generic because the staff members\\nmust still develop friendly COAs. The basis for the plan is the commander ’s initial information collection\\nguidance, the primary information gaps identified by the staff during mission analysis, and the enemy\\nsituational template developed during IPOE.\\nG-44. The intelligence staff creates the collection management tools (including the information collection\\nmatrix, information collection synchronization matrix, and information collection overlay) for the\\ninformation collection plan. The operations staff is res ponsible for the information collection plan. In\\ndeveloping the plan, the operations staff considers—\\n• Requirements for collection assets in subsequent missions.\\n• The time available to develop and refine the initial information collection plan.\\n• The risk the commander is willing to accept if information collection missions begin before the\\ninformation collection plan is fully integrated into the scheme of maneuver.\\n• Insertion and extraction methods for reconnaissance, security, surveillance, and intelligence units.\\n• Contingencies for inclement weather to ensure coverage of key NAIs or TAIs.\\n• The communications plan for transmission of reports from assets to tactical command posts (CPs).\\n• The inclusion of collection asset locations and movements into the fire support plan.\\n• The reconnaissance handover with higher or subordinate echelons.\\n• The sustainment support.\\n• Legal support requirements.\\nIssue</td>\n",

Different commanders act at more than one level of\\nwar, depending on the echelon of command. For example, a combatant commander (CCDR) formulates\\nt\\nheater strategy and designs the campaign plan. A land component commander assists a CCDR in campai gn\\nde\\nsign and may lead a field army during major operations. The levels of warfare are conceptual, without\\nfinite limits or boundaries.

They help\\ncommanders visualize the relationships and actions required to link strategic objectives, military operations\\nat various echelons, and tactical actions.

Success during operations demands timely and effective decisions based on applying judgement to\\navailable information and knowledge. As such, commanders and staffs seek to build and maintain situational\\nunderstanding throughout the operations process. Situational understanding is product of applying analysis\\nand judgment to relevant information to determine the relationships among the operational and mission\\nvariables.\\nOPERATIONAL VARIABLES \\nA-2. An operational environment (OE) is the aggregate of the conditions, circumstances, and influences that\\naffect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commander. For Army forces, an OE\\nincludes portions of the land, maritime, air, space, and cyberspace domains understood through three\\ndimensions (human, information, and physical). The land, maritime, air, and space domains are defined by\\nt\\nheir physical areas. The cyberspace domain, a man -made network of networks, transits and connects  the\\not\\nher domains through the electromagnetic spectrum. (See FM 3-0 for a more detailed discussion of an OE.)\\nA-3. Understanding an OE forms the basis for decision making during planning, preparation, execution, and\\nassessment of an operation.

When problems are difficult to identify, the operation’s end state is unclear, or a course of action (COA)\\nis not self-evident, commanders employ ADM. This is often the case when developing long- range plans for\\nextended operations. ADM is a methodology for applying critical and creative thinking to understand,\\nvisualize, and describe problems and approaches to solving them. ADM is particularly useful as an aid to\\nconceptual planning, but it must be integrated with the detailed planning typically associated with the MDMP\\nto produce executable plans and orders. ADM may be conducted before, concurrent with, or after the MDMP. \\nThere is no one way or prescribed set of steps to employ the ADM. There are, however, several activities\\nassociated with ADM including—\\n• Framing an OE.\\n• Framing problems.\\n• Developing an operational approach.\\n• Reframing (as required).\\n1-55. While planners complete some activities before others, the understanding and learning within one\\nactivity may require revisiting the learning from another activity. Based on their understanding and learning\\ngained during ADM, commanders issue planning guidance—including an operational approach—to guide\\nmore detailed planning using the MDMP. (See Chapter 4 for information on employing ADM.)\\nTHE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n1-56. The MDMP is an iterative planning methodology used to understand the problem or problems,\\nunderstand the situation and mission, develop COAs, decide on a COA, and produce an OPLAN or order. It\\nis an orderly, analytical process that integrates the activities of the commander, staff, and subordinate\\nheadquarters in the development of a plan or order. The MDMP helps leaders apply thoroughness, clarity,\\nsound judgement, logic, and professional knowledge to develop situational understanding and produce a plan\\nor order that accomplishes the mission.\\nNote. Depending on the situation, including the time available for planning, commanders may \\ninitiate the MDMP without the benefits of conducting ADM</td>\n",

The commander personally leads the conceptual component of planning. While commanders are\\nengaged in parts of detailed planning, they leave most specifics to staff officers. Conceptual planning\\nprovides the basis for subsequent planning. The commander’ s intent and operational approach provide the\\nframework for the entire plan. This framework leads to a concept of operations and associated schemes of\\nsupport, such as schemes of maneuver, intelligence, fires, protection, engineer operations, information, and\\ns\\nustainment. In turn, the schemes of support lead to the specifics of execution, including tasks to subordinate\\nunits and attachments (including annexes, appendices, tabs, and exhibits) to the base OPLAN or OPORD.\\nHowever, this dynamic does not operate in only one direction. Conceptual planning must respond to detailed\\nconstraints. For example, the realities of a deployment schedule (a detailed concern) influence the operational \\napproach (a conceptual concern).\\n1-52. Planning requires the integration of both conceptual thinking and detailed analysis. Army leaders\\nemploy several methodologies for planning, determining the appropriate mix based on the scope and\\nunderstanding of the problem, time available, and availability of a staff. Army planning methodologies\\ninclude—\\n• Army problem solving.\\n• Army design methodology (ADM).\\n• The military decision-making process (MDMP).\\n• Rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP).\\n• Troop leading procedures (TLP).\\nARMY PROBLEM SOLVING \\n1-53. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for Army leaders. Army\\nproblem solving forms the base logic of other planning methodologies. Where other methodologies are\\ndesigned for planning operations, Army problem solving is a methodology available for leaders to use to\\ni\\ndentify and solve a variety of problems both in garrison and in operations. Army problem solving is an\\nanalytical approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the\\nbest solution, developing a plan, and implementing that plan to solve the problem. The steps to Army problem \\nsolving are—\\n\\nChapter 1 \\n10 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\n• Step 1 - Gather information.\\n•</td>\n",

Additional staff members by area of\\nexpertise, liaison officers, and unified action partners are added to the team as required. When trying to plan\\ncollaboratively, those organizations or subordinate units must be notified to ensure the right personnel are\\nidentified to support the planning effort. Typically, for new missions or large planning efforts, the planning\\nteam may consist of representatives from all staff sections and unit liaison officers.

Both types of joint plans have four levels of details: commander ’s estimate, base plan, co ncept\\nplan, and OPLAN.\\nD-4. An operation plan is a complete and detailed plan containing a full description of the concept of\\noperations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time -phased force and deployment list (JP 5- 0). An\\nOPLAN may address an extended period that connects a series of objectives and operations, or it may be\\ndeveloped for a single part or phase of a long- term operation. An OPLAN becomes an operation order\\n(OPORD) when the commander sets an execution time or designates an event that triggers the operation.\\nD-5. A supporting plan is an operation plan prepared by a supporting commander, a subordinate\\ncommander, or an agency to satisfy the requests or requirements of the supported commander’s plan (JP 5-0).\\nF\\nor example, an ARFOR commander develops a supporting plan for how Army forces will support the joint\\nforce commander’s campaign plan or OPLAN.\\nAppendix D \\n198 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nD-6. A branch is the contingency options built into the base plan. A branch is used for changing the mission,\\norientation, or direction of movement of a force to aid success of the operation based on anticipated events,\\nopportunities, or disruptions caused by enemy actions and reactions. Branches add flexibility to plans by\\nanticipating situations that could alter the basic plan or order.\\nD-7. A sequel is the subsequent major operation or phase based on the possible outcomes of the current\\nmajor operation or phase. For every action or major operation that does not accomplish a strategic or\\noperational objective, there should be a sequel for each possible outcome, such as win, lose, draw, or decisive\\nwin.\\nTYPES OF ORDERS \\nD-8.

Planning keeps the force oriented on future objectives despite the requirements of current operations.\\nPlanning is essential for seizing and retaining the initiative by allowing commanders and staffs to consider\\npotential decisions and actions in advance. Planning reduces the time between decisions and actions during\\nexecution, especially at higher echelons. While some actions are implemented immediately, others require\\nforethought and preparation. For example, changing the direction of attack may be a relatively simple and\\nimmediate matter for a battalion; however, changing the scheme of maneuver for a division, including all its\\nsupport, is complicated and time consuming. Changing the priority of fires at division level may take\\nconsiderable time if artillery units must reposition. If leaders wait until an event occurs to begin planning and\\npreparing for a response, units may not be able to react quickly enough, ceding the initiative to enemy forces.\\n1-45. During execution planners continue to develop or refine options for potential enemy action and friendly \\nopportunities. By anticipating potential events and transitions beforehand, planning promotes flexibility a nd\\nr\\napid decision making during execution. As  a result, the force anticipates events and acts purposefully and\\neffectively before the enemy can act or before situations deteriorate. Several tools are available to the\\ncommander and planners to assist in adapting to changing circumstances. These tools include —\\n• Decision points.\\n• Branches.\\n• Sequels.\\n1-46. A decision point is a point in space and the latest time when the commander or staff anticipates making\\na key decision concerning a specific course of action ( JP 5-0). A decision point is associated to actions by\\nthe enemy, the friendly force, or the population, and it is tied to a commander ’s critical information\\nrequirement (CCIR).

While an operational approach is broad, it describes the commander’s visualization in time, space, and\\npurpose. It also addresses resources required to support the operational approach and accounts for risk. After\\nforming a framework for the operational approach using lines of operations and lines of effort, commanders\\nand planning teams consider additional elements of operational art to refine the operational approach.\\nAdditional elements of operational art to consider include—\\n• Operational reach, basing, and culmination.\\n• Tempo.\\n• Phasing and transitions.\\n• Risk.\\nOperational Reach, Basing, and Culmination \\n4-81. Operational reach is the distance and duration across which a force can successfully employ its\\ncapabilities. The skillful positioning of forces, reserves, bases, and equipment extend operational reach.\\nAlthough reach might be constrained or limited by the geography, enemy forces, and adversaries in and\\naround an operational area, reach is extended by—\\n• Forward positioning of capabilities and resources.\\n• Increasing the range and effectiveness of weapons systems.\\n• Leveraging host-nation support and contract support.\\n4-82. Basing, in the broadest sense, is an indispensable part of operational art. It is tied to lines of operations,\\nand it affects operational reach. In particular, the arrangement and positioning of bases in an operational area\\nunderwrites the ability of the force to protect its components from enemy action while expanding the distance \\nand duration of its capabilities. Commanders consider bases and base camps as intermediate staging bases,\\nlodgments (subsequently developed into base camps or potentially bases), and forward operating bases as\\npart of the operational approach.\\n4-83. Commanders consider culmination when developing their operational approach and visualizi ng\\nr\\nesources to support it. Culmination is that point in time and space at which a force no longer possesses the\\ncapability to continue its current form of operations. Culmination means a shift in relative combat power. It\\nis relevant to both attackers and defenders at each level of warfare. While conducting offensive tasks, th e\\nc\\nulminating point occurs when the force cannot continue the attack, and it assumes a defensive posture or\\nexecutes an operational pause.

Discuss how electromagnetic protection \\nincludes actions taken to ensure friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as frequency agility in a \\nradio or variable pulse repetition frequency in radar and how electromagnetic protection protects U.S. and \\nallied systems from the effects of fr iendly and enemy electromagnetic attack and electromagnetic \\ninterference. Describe how defensive electromagnetic attack primarily protects friendly personnel and \\nequipment or platforms against lethal attacks by denying enemy use of the electromagnetic spectrum to guide \\nor trigger weapons. Examples include self-protection and other protection measures such as the use of \\nexpendables (flares and active decoys), jammers, towed decoys, directed -energy infrared countermeasures, \\nand counter radio-controlled improvised explosive device systems. Describe how electromagnetic spectrum \\nmanagement enables electronic systems to perform their functions in the intended environment without \\ncausing or suffering unacceptable interference. Refer to Appendix 14 (electromagnetic protection) to Annex \\nE (Protection) as required. \\n(15) (U\\n) Cyberspace Security and Defense.  Describe how cyberspace security and defens e\\n(cyberspace security activities and defensive cyberspace operations -internal defensive measures) secures \\nand defends the network through a defense-in-depth approach, incorporating layered security and defenses. \\nDiscuss how cyberspace security is the prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, \\ncommunications systems, communications services, wire communication, and electromagnetic \\ncommunication, including information contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity, authentication, \\nconfidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

Assessment information requirements compete with other information\\nrequirements for resources. When an information requirement is not resourced, staffs cannot collect the\\nassociated indicator and must remove it from the plan. Staffs then adjust the assessment framework to ensure\\nthat the MOE or MOP is properly worded.\\nSTEP 5 - ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR CONDUCTING ANALYSIS AND GENERATING\\nRECOMMENDATIONS \\n8-31.  In addition to assigning responsibility for collection, commanders assign staff members to analyze\\nassessment data and develop recommendations. For example, the intelligence officer leads the assessment of\\nenemy forces. The engineer officer leads the effort on assessing infrastructure and development. The civil\\naffairs operations officer leads assessment concerning the progress of local and provincial governments. The\\nchief of staff (COS ) aggressively requires staff principals and subject matter experts to participate in\\nprocessing the formal assessment and in generating smart, actionable recommendations. The operations\\nresearch and analysis officer assists the commander and staff with developing both assessment frameworks\\nand the command’s assessment process.\\nSTEP 6 - IDENTIFY FEEDBACK MECHANISM \\n8-32. A formal assessment with meaningful recommendations that is not presented to the appropriate\\ndecision maker wastes time and energy. The assessment plan identifies the who, what, when, where, and why\\nof that presentation. The commander and staff also discuss feedback leading up to and following that\\npresentation. Feedback might include which assessment working groups the commander requires and how to\\nact on and follow up on recommendations.\\nASSESSMENT WITHIN THE MILITARY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS \\n8-33. Formal assessment planning happens concurrent with each step of the MDMP. Throughout the process\\nthe assessment cell remains engaged with the planning team to ensure the assessment follows the logic of the\\nplan or order that will be produced and executed. Table 8 -1 on pages 162 through 163 lists assessment\\nplanning activities performed during each of the planning steps of the MDMP.\\nChapter 8 \\n162 FM 5-0 04 November 2024 \\nTable 8-1.
