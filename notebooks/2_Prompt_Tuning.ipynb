Contingency plans are often phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable to the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termination criteria. They address military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n- 2-33. Planning for a contingency encompasses the activities associated with the development of plans for the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces and resources in response to potential crises  identified  in  joint  strategic  planning documents.  The  level  of  planning  detail of contingency plans varies based on guidance and changes in the security environment. Planning details range from level 1 to level 4 as discussed in paragraphs 2-34 through 2-37. Although listed sequentially, during a crisis they may be conducted concurrently or compressed depending on the situation and conditions. (See JP 5-0 for more information on contingency planning and associated levels of planning detail.)\\n\\n## Level 1-Commander's Estimate\\n\\n- 2-34. The commander's estimate is the commander's initial assessment in which options are provided in a concise  statement  that  defines  who,  what,  when,  where,  why,  and  how  the  course  of  action  will  be implemented (JP 5-0). The commander's estimate, at planning level 1, involves the least amount of detail and focuses on producing multiple courses of action (COAs) to address a contingency. The product for this level can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander's estimate, or a memorandum with a required force  list.  The  commander's  estimate  provides  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  military  COAs  to  meet  a potential contingency.\\n\\n## Level 2-Base Plan\\n\\n- 2-35. A base plan, at planning level 2, describes the concept of operations, major forces, schemes of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes. A base plan may contain alternatives, including flexible deterrent operations, to provide flexibility in addressing a contingency as it develops or to aid in developing the situation.\\n\\n## Level 3-Concept Plan\\n\\n- 2-36.

METT-TC (I) represents the mission variables leaders use to analyze and understand a situation in relationship to the unit's mission. Informational considerations are those aspects of the human, information and physical dimensions that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, use, act upon, and  are  impacted  by  information  (FM  3-0).  Informational  considerations  is  expressed  as  a  parenthetical variable in that it is not an independent variable, but an important component of each variable of METT-TC that leaders pay particular attention to when developing understanding of a situation. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the mission variables.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND, AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS\\n\\n- 1-26. Planning  helps  leaders  better  understand  and  identify  problems  and  develop  solutions  to  solve  or manage those problems. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or objective. In a broad sense, a problem exists when an individual becomes aware of a significant difference between what is currently observed or occurring in the environment, and what is desired. In the context of operations, an operational problem is the issue or set of issues that impede commanders from achieving their desired  end  state.  (See  paragraph  1-53  for  further  discussion  on  identification  of  problems  and  problem solving.) Identification of the actual problem to solve is critical to successful planning. Misidentification of the problem often leads to an ineffective plan and operational approach and time critical to subordinates for development of their plans.\\n- 1-27. Throughout operations, Army leaders face various problems, requiring unique and creative solutions. Not all problems require the same level of planning. Leaders often identify simple problems immediately and quickly decide on a solution-sometimes on the spot. However, planning is critical when a problem is a set of interrelated issues, and the solution to each issue affects the others. For unfamiliar situations, planning offers ways to solve the complete set of problems. In general, the more complex a situation is, the more important and involved the planning effort becomes.\\n\\n- 1-28. Just as planning is only part of the operations   \n",

Commanders and staffs use Annex P (Host-Nation Support) to describe how sustainment operations support the concept of operations described in the base plan or order. The G-4 or S-4 is the staff officer responsible for Annex P (Host-Nation Support).\\n- E-59. Host-nation support is the civil and military assistance provided by the host nation to the forces located in or transiting through that host-nation's territory. Efficient use of available host-nation support can greatly aid forces and augment the deployed sustainment structure.

       "4   the assessment is also largely subjective. Planners may also consider time and space when developing force ratios to more accurately assess where and when engagements could occur and how to determine appropriate force ratios.\\n\\n5-84. Planners first compare tangible factors of friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses, and vice versa, for  combat  maneuver  units  and  functional  and  multifunctional  units,  as  necessary.  From  this  objective analysis, planners produce force ratios which highlight advantages or vulnerabilities for each force that may be exploited or may need additional considerations or protection. These comparisons provide planners insight into effective force employment recommendations. (Refer to FM 3-0 for more information on the dynamics of combat power.)\\n\\n5-85. After computing force ratios, the staff analyzes the intangible aspects of combat power. A technique for this analysis is conducting a subjective comparison of friendly strengths and enemy weaknesses for each dynamic of combat power. The resulting analysis can be beneficial by either reinforcing or offsetting the advantages and vulnerabilities identified by the objective analysis. Often, the intangible factors are more\\n\\nimportant than the number of tanks or tubes of artillery. This can lead to planner's effectively identifying decision points for the effective employment of forces. (See table 5-4 for an example of a relative combat power assessment.)\\n\\nTable 5-4. Example relative combat power assessment\\n\\n5-86. In troop-to-task analysis for stability and defense support of civil authorities, staffs determine relative combat power by comparing available resources to specified or implied stability or defense support of civil authorities tasks. This analysis provides insights into available options and needed resources.\\n\\n## Generate Options\\n\\n5-87. Based on the commander's guidance and the results of the initial relative combat power assessment, the staff generates options. A good COA can defeat feasible enemy COAs and ensure the unit remains flexible to execute branches or sequels. In an unconstrained planning environment, planners aim to develop several possible COAs. Depending on available time, commanders may limit the planning options, consistent with the commander's guidance. Options focus on enemy COAs arranged in order of their probable adoption.\\n\\n5-88. Brainstorming can be used for generating options. It requires extra time, imagination, and creativity, but it produces the widest range of options. The staff (and members of organizations outside the headquarters) remains unbiased and open-minded when developing proposed options.\\n\\n- 5-89. In  developing    \n",
       "5                             commanders  execute  it  because something planned has or has not been successful. In planning priorities, commanders plan a be-prepared mission after any on-order mission.\\n- 5-38. Once staff members have identified specified and implied tasks, they ensure understanding of each task's requirements and purpose. The staff then identifies one or two essential tasks. An essential task is a specified or implied task that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential tasks are always included in the unit's mission statement.\\n\\n## Review Available Assets and Identify Resource Shortfalls\\n\\n5-39. The commander and staff analyze the current task organization, command and support relationships, and status (including current capabilities and limitations) of all units, specifically identifying changes. This analysis also includes capabilities of civilian and military organizations (including joint and multinational) that  operate  within  their  unit's  assigned  area  or  are  otherwise  designated  to  support.  They  consider relationships  among  specified,  implied,  and  essential  tasks  and  available  assets.  Staff  officers  use  the capabilities and resources recorded in their running estimates as a starting point for their analysis. From this analysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all tasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commanders a rough comparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may request from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success. Staffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commanders to understand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets and relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\n\\n## Determine Constraints\\n\\n5-40. The  commander  and  staff  identify  any  constraints  placed  on  their  command.  A constraint is  a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the OPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example, may contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs, or in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a starting point to their analysis.   \n",

Internally, this interaction allows the staff to receive guidance from the commander and resolve issues as they arise. Additionally,  it  provides  a  structure  and  framework  for  the  staff  to  work  collectively  and  produce  a coordinated plan. Externally, the MDMP facilitates information sharing among headquarters. As decisions, information, and staff products become available, the higher headquarters sends them to subordinates in WARNORDs.  WARNORDs  facilitate  parallel  planning  by  providing  critical  information  to  allow subordinates to start necessary planning and preparation activities.\\n\\n## Role of the Commander\\n\\n- 5-7. Commanders are the most important participants in the MDMP. Through their presence and actions, commanders  actively  drive  this  portion  of  the  operations  process.  More  than  simply  decision  makers, commanders use  their  experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  to  guide  staff  planning  efforts.  During  the MDMP, commanders focus their activities on understanding and visualizing the OE and describing their commander's visualization. While unable to devote all their time to the MDMP, commanders follow the status of the planning effort, participate during critical points of the process, provide guidance, and make decisions based on the detailed work of their staff. The commander issues guidance throughout the MDMP including, but not limited, to the following:\\n- · Upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission (initial planning guidance).\\n- · Following mission analysis (planning guidance for COA development, the desired end state and commander's intent).\\n- · Following COA development (revised planning guidance for COA analysis).\\n- · During COA approval (revised planning guidance to complete the plan).\\n- · Upon receipt of new information that invalidates assumptions or changes understanding of the OE.\\n\\n5-8. Commanders use their experience and judgment to add depth and clarity to their planning guidance. They ensure staffs understand the broad outline of their visualization while allowing the latitude necessary to explore different options. This guidance provides the basis for a detailed concept of operations without dictating the specifics of the final plan. As with their intent, the commander may modify planning guidance based on staff and subordinate input and changing conditions.\\n\\n5-9.

The chapter begins by discussing problem solving as related to decision making. This chapter establishes the base logic for all other problem-solving planning processes. The chapter concludes by discussing the seven-step process used in Army problem solving.\\n\\n## PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING\\n\\n- 3-1. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for leaders. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal, objective, or end state. Army problem solving is a form of decision making. It is a systematic approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the best solution, and implementing it. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to also do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success.\\n- 3-2. Not all problems require lengthy analysis to solve. For simple problems, leaders often make decisions quickly-sometimes  on  the  spot.  However,  for  complicated  problems  involving  a  variety  of  factors,  a systematic  problem-solving  approach  is  essential.  How  much  analysis  is  required  to  effectively  solve  a problem depends on the problem's complexity, the leader's experience, and amount of time available.\\n- 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally. (See FM 6-0 for more information on staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings.)\\n- 3-4. Problem solving is an art and science. It is a structured analytic process designed to ensure that all critical factors relevant to the problem are considered, and the relationships between variables are anticipated and accounted for in the solution. This ensures that the desired objective or end state is achieved in the most effective and efficient manner.\\n- 3-5. The art of problem solving involves subjective analysis of variables that, in many cases, cannot be easily measured. Leadership and morale, for example, are difficult to measure, but they   \n",

Prepared by DOD and approved by the President, the CPG fulfills the statutory requirement in Title 10, USC, Section 113 and provides written policy guidance on the preparation and review of campaign and contingency plans (including prioritization) to the CJCS and CCDRs for contingency planning. Contingency\\n\\nplans are branches of combatant command campaign plans. The CPG focuses the guidance given in the NSS and NDS and is the principal source document for the JSCP. (See paragraphs 2-31 through 2-33 for more information on contingency planning.)\\n\\n## Joint Strategic Campaign Plan\\n\\n- 2-16. The JSCP fulfills  the  CJCS's  statutory  responsibilities  in Title  10,  USC,  Section  153,  to  assist  the President and Secretary of Defense in providing for strategic direction to the joint force and implementing the strategic guidance in the NSS, NDS, NMS, and CPG. The JSCP provides this guidance to CCDRs, Service chiefs,  combat support agencies and applicable DOD agencies for preparation of plans based on current military capabilities, strategic guidance and contingency planning guidance identified to the CJCS in the CPG.\\n- 2-17. In addition to communicating to the CCMDs' specific planning guidance, the JSCP operationalizes the strategic vision described in the NMS and nests with the strategic direction delineated by the NSS, NDS, and GFMIG. The JSCP also provides integrated planning guidance and direction for planners to fulfill the CJCS's role as the global integrator.\\n\\n## Global Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-18. A global campaign plan is the primary means by which the CJCS or designated CCDRs arrange for unity of effort through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs) and functional responsibilities. Global campaign plans address the most  pressing  transregional  and  multifunctional  strategic  challenges  across  all  domains.  Each  global campaign plan has an assigned coordinating authority which is a CCDR with the primary responsibility for a global campaign plan. Contingency plans to a global campaign plan are called integrated contingency plans.\\n\\n## Functional Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-19.

The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders. In the absence of the commander, key planning staff members must continually review progress and resolve questions and concerns with the commander at opportune times.\\n\\n- 1-137. The second pitfall is a lack of timely decisions by the commander necessary to continue effective planning. Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force.\\n- 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present. These plans often underestimate the scope of changes in directions that may occur and the results of second- and third-order effects. Even the most effective plans cannot anticipate all the unexpected events. Often, events overcome plans much sooner than anticipated. The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events.\\n- 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall  often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include. However, planners often respond to uncertainty by planning in more detail to try to account for every possibility. Often this overplanning results in an extremely detailed plan  that  does  not  survive  the  friction  of  the    \n",

       "15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               view capabilities in terms of those required to save, sustain, or enhance life, in that order of priority. Capabilities can refer to the ability of  local  authorities-those  of  the  host  nation,  aggressor  nation,  or  some  other  body-to  provide  the population with key functions or services, such as public administration, public safety, emergency services, and  food.  Primary  capabilities  include  those  areas  that  the  population  may  need  help  with  after  combat operations, such as public works and utilities, public health, economics, and commerce. Capabilities also refer to resources and services that can be contracted to support the military mission, such as interpreters, laundry services, construction materials, and equipment. The host nation or other nations might provide these resources and services.\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nA-32. Organizations are nonmilitary groups or institutions in an assigned area. They influence and interact with the population, the force, and each other. They generally have a hierarchical structure, defined goals, established operations, fixed facilities or meeting places, and a means of financial or logistic support. Some organizations may be indigenous to the area. These may include church groups, social organizations, patriotic or  service  organizations,  labor  unions,  criminal  organizations,  and  community  watch  groups.  Other organizations  may  come  from  outside  an  assigned  area.  Examples  of  these  include  multinational corporations, United Nations agencies, U.S. governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the International Red Cross.\\n\\nA-33. Operations  also  often  require  commanders  to  coordinate  with  international  organizations  and nongovernmental organizations. Commanders remain familiar with organizations operating in their assigned area. Relevant  information  includes  information  about  their  activities,  capabilities,  and  limitations. Situational understanding includes understanding how the activities of different organizations may affect\\n\\nmilitary  operations  and  how  military  operations  may  affect  these  organizations'  activities.  From  this, commanders can determine how organizations and military forces can work together toward common goals when necessary.\\n\\nA-34. At  certain  times,  every  echelon  of  command  will  interact  with  other  U.S.  agencies,  host-nation   \n",
       "16                                                                                                            total means of destructive and disruptive  force  that  a  military  unit/formation  can  apply  against  an  enemy  at  a  given  time  (JP  3-0). Designating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and priorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times during an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success at the time.\\n- 1-40. Commanders  resource  supporting  efforts  with  the  minimum  assets  necessary  to  accomplish  the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort in an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n- 1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the current tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when positioning  their  reserve.  While  commanders  can  assign  their  reserve  a  wide  variety  of  tasks,  through planning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n- 1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution as the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). Priorities of movement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support that commanders may use to weight the main effort.\\n\\n## ANTICIPATE EVENTS\\n\\n- 1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and coordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated uncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables the force to adapt to changing circumstances. Planning provides an informed forecast of how future events may unfold and anticipates transitions. It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in advance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and thirdorder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and threats.\\n\\n1-44   \n",

It includes providing forces and assets to subordinate commanders and establishing their command and support relationships. When task organizing their force, commanders visualize capabilities of units two echelons below them, based on their visualization of tasks to subordinates one echelon below them. Some assets are retained under the commander's immediate control to retain flexibility to exploit opportunities or counter threats.\\n- 1-36. Task organizing includes establishing command  or  support  relationships among  subordinate commanders. Army command relationships define command responsibility and authority.  Army  support relationships define the purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another. Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to task-organizing for any operation. (See FM 3-0 for a detailed discussion of joint, multinational, and Army command and support relationships.)\\n- 1-37. Task-organizing results in a task organization -a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a  particular  mission  (ADP  5-0).  The  unit's  task  organization  is  stipulated  in  the  base  plan  or  order  or addressed  in  Annex  A  (Task  Organization)  to  the  base  plan  or  order.  The  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or operation  order  (OPORD)  also  stipulates  changes  in  the  task  organization  by  phase.  During  execution, commanders modify the task organization as required based on the situation through fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs). (See Appendix E for task organization format and instructions.)\\n- 1-38.  Commanders prioritize efforts by designating a main effort, supporting efforts, and a reserve. The main effort is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a given point in time is most critical to overall mission success (ADP 3-0). A supporting effort is  a  designated subordinate unit with a mission that supports the success of the main effort (ADP 3-0). A reserve is  that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from action at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3-90).\\n- 1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power -the   \n",

U.S. doctrine and procedures for joint planning are applicable to multinational challenges. The general considerations for interaction with international organizations and partner-nation organizations are similar to those  for  interaction  with  U.S.  Government  departments  and  agencies.  (For  more  information  on  joint planning see JP-5-0.)\\n\\n## NATO PLANNING EFFORTS\\n\\n1-148. For NATO's operations, the United States and other NATO countries have developed and ratified an Allied joint doctrine hierarchy of publications outlining the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures that should be used during NATO operations. JFCs, their staffs, and subordinate forces should review and train with these publications prior to participating in NATO operations. For more information on NATO planning doctrine see AJP-5, Allied  Joint  Doctrine  for  the  Planning  of  Operations ,  or  APP-28, Tactical Planning for Land Forces .\\n\\n## MULTINATIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\n1-149. Multinational operations present unique challenges and demands throughout the planning process. Commanders  and  staffs  should  account  for  these  considerations  when  participating  in  multinational operations. The following are some of the considerations when planning multinational operations-\\n\\n- · Cultural and language issues.\\n- · Interoperability challenges.\\n- · National caveats on the use of respective forces.\\n- · The sharing of information and intelligence.\\n- · Rules of engagement.\\n- · Domestic and international laws.\\n- · Operational limitations on the use of contributed forces.\\n- · Weapons capabilities of participating nations.\\n- · Tactics of participating nations.\\n\\n(For more information on multinational operations planning, see FM 3-16.)\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n## Chapter 2\\n\\n## Planning and Operational Art\\n\\nThis chapter begins with a description of planning and the levels of warfare. A discussion of operational art follows. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the elements of operational art and the tools available to commanders and staffs in the application of operational art.\\n\\n## PLANNING AND THE LEVELS OF WARFARE\\n\\n- 2-1. Operational art spans a continuum-from strategic direction to   \n",
       "19                                                                                       require the command to reframe. As such, commanders and planning teams develop reframing indicators. A reframing indicator helps identify a condition in an OE that has changed or that could cause a shift in the problem such that a current operational  approach  may  no  longer  be  valid.  Although  many  reframing  indicators  will  not  meet  the requirement for the commander's critical information requirement (CCIRs), some reframing indicators could be included in the CCIRs if they represent something that would cause the commander to consider near-term reframing and potential redesign. An example of such information could be the impending alliance of a regional nation with the enemy that shifts the balance of power, even though an earlier assumption was that this alliance would not occur. Reframing indicators support the commander's ability to understand, learn, adapt, and reframe as necessary. Examples of such information include-\\n\\n- · Changes in the original problem statement.\\n- · Significant changes in threat composition.\\n- · Significant changes in the threat's approach.\\n- · Significant changes in friendly capability.\\n- · Higher echelon headquarters' policy changes or directives that change the desired end state.\\n- · Unexpected lack of friendly progress toward objectives.\\n- · Shifts in international support or domestic will.\\n- · Key assumptions prove to be invalid.\\n\\n## ASSESSMENT PLAN\\n\\n4-99. The assessment plan incorporates reframing criteria in the form of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) that are used to evaluate completed tasks, achieved objectives, and obtained end-state conditions. An effective assessment plan incorporates the logic used to build the plan. The logic as to why the commander believes the actions in the plan will produce the desired results is an important consideration when developing the assessment plan. Recording and understanding this logic during ADM helps the staff recommend the appropriate indicators for assessing the operation. It also helps the commander and staff determine if they need to reframe the problem if assumptions prove false or the logic behind the plan appears flawed as operations progress. (See Chapter 8 for details on building an assessment plan.)\\n\\n## Chapter 5\\n\\n## The Military Decision-Making Process\\n\\nThis chapter defines and describes the military decision-making process (MDMP). It provides an overview of the process followed by a detailed explanation for conducting each step of the MDMP. The chapter concludes with techniques for modifying the MDMP in a time-constrained   \n",
       "20                                                                                                                                                                               The staff's experience, cohesiveness, and level of rest or stress.\\n\\n- · Whether or not to conduct ADM.\\n- · How to abbreviate the MDMP if under a time constraint.\\n- · Guidance on when to use the rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP) during execution.\\n- · Planning team composition.\\n- · Time required to position critical elements, including command and control nodes for upcoming operations.\\n- · Which outside agencies and organizations to contact and incorporate into the planning process.\\n- · Other preparations the commander, staff, or subordinate units need to conduct before beginning planning.\\n\\n5-20. The initial assessment also helps determine when to begin certain actions to ensure forces are ready and in position before execution. This may require the commander to direct subordinates to start necessary movements, conduct task organization changes, begin information collection, and execute other preparation activities before completing the plan.\\n\\n- 5-21. Commanders and staffs allocate available planning time to prioritize different steps of the MDMP based on the given situation. For example, when conducting initial planning for a new operation, more time may be allocated to mission analysis than the other steps to develop a better understanding of the problem and OE. Time allocations will vary based on a variety of factors such as experience of the planning staff, products already available, and commander involvement. Table 5-1 depicts an example planning time allocation.\\n\\nTable 5-1. Planning time allocation\\n\\nNote. The initial time allocation is made during Step 1 to guide initial planning efforts. The commander and staff continue to adjust it as they gain a better understanding of time available during the following steps of the MDMP.\\n\\n5-22. Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. Time, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The commander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum time for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of two-thirds  of  available  time  for  subordinate  units  to  conduct  their  planning  and  preparation.  This  leaves one-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the other  two-thirds  for  their  own  preparation.  Commanders  should  consider    \n",

Describe  how  defensive  electromagnetic  attack  primarily  protects  friendly  personnel  and equipment or platforms against lethal attacks by denying enemy use of the electromagnetic spectrum to guide or  trigger  weapons.

In addition to planning, problem solving includes implementing the planned solution (execution), learning from the implementation of the solution (assessment), and modifying or developing a new solution as required. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success. (See Chapter 3 on Army problem solving.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, MITIGATE, AND ACCEPT RISK\\n\\n- 1-29. Risk-the  exposure  of  someone  or  something  valued  to  danger,  harm,  or  loss-is  inherent  in  all operations. Because risk is part of all military operations, it cannot be avoided. Risk may range for resource shortfall or a course of actions that exposed a friendly force's flank. Identifying, mitigating, and accepting risk is a function of command and a key consideration during planning.\\n- 1-30. During  planning,  commanders  and  staffs  analyze  risk  in  collaboration  with  subordinates  and  their higher-level headquarters to help determine what level of risk exists and how to mitigate it. When considering how much risk to accept with a course of action, commanders consider risk to the force and risk to the mission against the perceived benefit. They apply judgment with regards to the importance of an objective, time available, and anticipated cost. Commanders balance the tension between protecting the force and accepting and managing risks that must be taken to accomplish their mission. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk as an element of operational art.)\\n\\n## DIRECT, COORDINATE, AND SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS\\n\\n- 1-31. Plans  and  orders  are  the  principal  means  commanders  use  to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize actions. They also inform those outside the unit how to cooperate and provide support. Effective plans and orders direct subordinates by stating what is required (the task) and why (the purpose). They leave much of the how (the method) up to subordinates.\\n- 1-32. Plans and orders contain control measures to coordinate and synchronize action. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions (ADP 6-0). Control measures aid in coordinating forces without imposing needless restrictions on their  freedom  of  action.  Commanders  use   \n",

This subparagraph uses the same format as the base order and can be shortened by using the phrase 'See Base Order' if there is no change.\\n- (1) (U) Higher Headquarters Two Levels Up . Identify the higher headquarters' mission and commander's intent two echelons above.\\n- (2) (U) Higher Headquarters One Level Up . Identify the higher headquarters' mission, commander's intent, and concept of operations one echelon above.\\n- ( 3) (U) Missions of Adjacent Units . As needed, identify and state the missions of adjacent units and other units whose actions have a significant impact on the issuing headquarters.\\n- e. (U) Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Nongovernmental Organizations . Identify and describe other organizations in the assigned area that may impact the conduct of the unit's operations or require support not identified in the base order. Also identify nongovernmental organizations in the assigned area that want nothing to do with the U.S. military and are not identified in the base order. Refer to Annex V (Interagency Coordination) as required.\\n- f. (U) Civil Considerations. List all critical civil considerations that impact on the unit's operations, such as cultural or religious sensitivities to male Soldiers searching female civilians, searching civilian homes at night,   \n",
       "25                                                                                 higher echelon commanders and unified action partners in defining problems and developing common expectations regarding resolution. This is vital to develop an effective operational approach to solve or manage identified problems. Here is an example of an initial problem statement based on the Freeland scenario.\\n\\nProblem statement: Aggressland forces are escalating their offensive activities against Freeland to destabilize the democratic government in Freeland and expand their regional hegemony. For more than fifty years, Freeland has maintained diplomatic, information, military, and economic autonomy. Other regional nations and world democracies have provided limited diplomatic and military support to Freeland, but these efforts have been insufficient to deter border incursions from Aggressland. Freeland is a diplomatic and economic partner to the U.S., but military partnership has been limited due to potentially negative international policy impacts. Freeland's military and civil defense forces are limited in size but are relatively modern. Aggressland has maintained a long-standing strategic rivalry with the U.S. To maintain deterrence and regional access, prevent crisis in Freeland, and bolster regional stability, the U.S. must be prepared for armed conflict in support of the defense of Freeland.\\n\\n- 4-63. Commanders and planners continue to develop the problem narrative as they learn more about an OE and develop an operational approach. For example, the small size of the Freeland defense force is a significant issue,  but  not  the  only  one.  After  discussing  the  problem  narrative  with  the  commander  and  others,  the planning team may expand the narrative by including problems associated with-\\n- · Availability of potential ports or intermediate staging locations for military forces.\\n- · Potential for special purpose attacks against regional partners, forward deployed military forces, or sustainment nodes.\\n- · Reinforcement of Freeland armed forces.\\n- · Influence of the adversary on other regional neighbors of Freeland.\\n- · Established adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities surrounding Freeland.\\n\\n## DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH\\n\\n4-64. Once commanders and planners agree on the problem or set of problems, they develop ways to address them. They do this by developing an operational approach-a description of the broad actions the force must take  to  transform  current  conditions  into  those  desired  at  end  state.  An  operational  approach  is  the commander's visualization of what needs to be done to solve or manage identified problems   \n",

This annex provides considerations, formats, and instructions for developing Annex L (Information Collection),  also  referred  to  as  collection  management  or  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance operations.  Information  collection  uses  a  mix of  ground, air,  and  space  collection  platforms  at  the  joint, operational, and strategic levels, articulated in Army plans and orders. This annex provides a format that can be modified to meet the requirements of the base order and operations. Paragraphs throughout this annex are applicable to all formation types, unless annotated. This annex follows the five-paragraph attachment format.\\n\\nE-50. The information collection annex clearly describes how information collection activities support the offensive,  defensive,  and  stability  operations  or  defense  support  of  civil  authorities  tasks  throughout  the conduct of the operations described in the base order. It synchronizes activities in time, space, and purpose to achieve objectives and accomplish the commander's intent for information collection (including military intelligence disciplines). The G-3 or S-3, in conjunction with the G-2 or S-2, is responsible for this annex.

Leaders understand the status of their Soldiers' morale, their experience and training, and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. They determine all available resources and assess their capabilities. This  includes  troops  attached  to,  or  in  direct  support  of,  the  unit.  The  assessment  includes  knowing  the strength and status of unit equipment. It also includes understanding the full array of assets in support of the unit.  Leaders  know,  for  example,  how  much  indirect  fire,  space,  cyberspace,  or  information  operation capabilities will become available, when they are available, and they will know the best assets to inform planning. Leaders should consider any new limitations based on the level of training or recent operations.\\n\\n## TIME AVAILABLE\\n\\nA-26. Leaders not only appreciate how much time is available, but they also understand the time and space aspects  of  preparing,  moving,  fighting,  and  sustaining.  They  view  their  own  tasks  and  enemy  actions  in relation to time. They know how long it takes under different conditions to prepare for certain tasks (such as orders production, rehearsals, and subordinate element preparations). Leaders should remain mindful of the extended  timelines  generally  associated  with  achieving  information  effects  such  as  achieving  cognitive effects on enemy forces or creating and executing desired offensive cyberspace effects. Most importantly, leaders monitor the time available. As events occur, they assess their impact on the unit timeline and update previous timelines for their subordinates. Timelines list all events that affect the unit and its subordinate elements.\\n\\n## CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nA-27. Military  operations  are  rarely  conducted  in  uninhabited  areas.  Units  are  often  surrounded  by noncombatants. These noncombatants may include residents within the assigned area, local officials, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Leaders strive to understand the behaviors and attitudes of populations, to include discerning if they are hostile, friendly, or neutral to friendly forces and how they may be influenced. Based on information from higher echelon headquarters and their own knowledge and judgment, leaders identify civil considerations that affect their mission. Commanders typically analyze civil considerations using six factors known collectively as ASCOPE: areas,   \n",

State  the  scheme of engineer reconnaissance by task and purpose  for  engineer  tactical  and  technical  reconnaissance  including  infrastructure  reconnaissance requirements.\\n- b. (U) Tasks to Subordinate Units. List engineering tasks to specific units that are not assigned in the base plan or order. List tasks specific to engineering and mobility, countermobility, and survivability assets only as necessary to ensure unity of effort. Specific and detailed task descriptions should be done in each respective appendix as applicable.\\n- c. (U) Coordinating Instructions. List only instructions applicable to two or more subordinate units not covered in the base plan or order. Provide additional coordinating instructions for the following:\\n- (1) (U) Identify and list the times or events when obstacle control measures become effective.\\n- (2) (U) List supported unit information requirements focused on mobility, countermobility, and survivability  that  must  be  considered  by  subordinate  engineer  staff  officers  or  that  the  supported  unit requires. This includes engineer-related commander's critical information requirements and perhaps the requests for information that have already been submitted to higher.\\n- (3) (U) Explain and describe the countermobility and survivability timelines.\\n- 4.

Contingency plans are often phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable to the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termination criteria. They address military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n- 2-33. Planning for a contingency encompasses the activities associated with the development of plans for the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces and resources in response to potential crises  identified  in  joint  strategic  planning documents.  The  level  of  planning  detail of contingency plans varies based on guidance and changes in the security environment. Planning details range from level 1 to level 4 as discussed in paragraphs 2-34 through 2-37. Although listed sequentially, during a crisis they may be conducted concurrently or compressed depending on the situation and conditions. (See JP 5-0 for more information on contingency planning and associated levels of planning detail.)\\n\\n## Level 1-Commander's Estimate\\n\\n- 2-34. The commander's estimate is the commander's initial assessment in which options are provided in a concise  statement  that  defines  who,  what,  when,  where,  why,  and  how  the  course  of  action  will  be implemented (JP 5-0). The commander's estimate, at planning level 1, involves the least amount of detail and focuses on producing multiple courses of action (COAs) to address a contingency. The product for this level can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander's estimate, or a memorandum with a required force  list.  The  commander's  estimate  provides  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  military  COAs  to  meet  a potential contingency.\\n\\n## Level 2-Base Plan\\n\\n- 2-35. A base plan, at planning level 2, describes the concept of operations, major forces, schemes of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes. A base plan may contain alternatives, including flexible deterrent operations, to provide flexibility in addressing a contingency as it develops or to aid in developing the situation.\\n\\n## Level 3-Concept Plan\\n\\n- 2-36.

METT-TC (I) represents the mission variables leaders use to analyze and understand a situation in relationship to the unit's mission. Informational considerations are those aspects of the human, information and physical dimensions that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, use, act upon, and  are  impacted  by  information  (FM  3-0).  Informational  considerations  is  expressed  as  a  parenthetical variable in that it is not an independent variable, but an important component of each variable of METT-TC that leaders pay particular attention to when developing understanding of a situation. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the mission variables.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND, AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS\\n\\n- 1-26. Planning  helps  leaders  better  understand  and  identify  problems  and  develop  solutions  to  solve  or manage those problems. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or objective. In a broad sense, a problem exists when an individual becomes aware of a significant difference between what is currently observed or occurring in the environment, and what is desired. In the context of operations, an operational problem is the issue or set of issues that impede commanders from achieving their desired  end  state.  (See  paragraph  1-53  for  further  discussion  on  identification  of  problems  and  problem solving.) Identification of the actual problem to solve is critical to successful planning. Misidentification of the problem often leads to an ineffective plan and operational approach and time critical to subordinates for development of their plans.\\n- 1-27. Throughout operations, Army leaders face various problems, requiring unique and creative solutions. Not all problems require the same level of planning. Leaders often identify simple problems immediately and quickly decide on a solution-sometimes on the spot. However, planning is critical when a problem is a set of interrelated issues, and the solution to each issue affects the others. For unfamiliar situations, planning offers ways to solve the complete set of problems. In general, the more complex a situation is, the more important and involved the planning effort becomes.\\n\\n- 1-28. Just as planning is only part of the operations   \n",

Commanders and staffs use Annex P (Host-Nation Support) to describe how sustainment operations support the concept of operations described in the base plan or order. The G-4 or S-4 is the staff officer responsible for Annex P (Host-Nation Support).\\n- E-59. Host-nation support is the civil and military assistance provided by the host nation to the forces located in or transiting through that host-nation's territory. Efficient use of available host-nation support can greatly aid forces and augment the deployed sustainment structure.

       "34  the assessment is also largely subjective. Planners may also consider time and space when developing force ratios to more accurately assess where and when engagements could occur and how to determine appropriate force ratios.\\n\\n5-84. Planners first compare tangible factors of friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses, and vice versa, for  combat  maneuver  units  and  functional  and  multifunctional  units,  as  necessary.  From  this  objective analysis, planners produce force ratios which highlight advantages or vulnerabilities for each force that may be exploited or may need additional considerations or protection. These comparisons provide planners insight into effective force employment recommendations. (Refer to FM 3-0 for more information on the dynamics of combat power.)\\n\\n5-85. After computing force ratios, the staff analyzes the intangible aspects of combat power. A technique for this analysis is conducting a subjective comparison of friendly strengths and enemy weaknesses for each dynamic of combat power. The resulting analysis can be beneficial by either reinforcing or offsetting the advantages and vulnerabilities identified by the objective analysis. Often, the intangible factors are more\\n\\nimportant than the number of tanks or tubes of artillery. This can lead to planner's effectively identifying decision points for the effective employment of forces. (See table 5-4 for an example of a relative combat power assessment.)\\n\\nTable 5-4. Example relative combat power assessment\\n\\n5-86. In troop-to-task analysis for stability and defense support of civil authorities, staffs determine relative combat power by comparing available resources to specified or implied stability or defense support of civil authorities tasks. This analysis provides insights into available options and needed resources.\\n\\n## Generate Options\\n\\n5-87. Based on the commander's guidance and the results of the initial relative combat power assessment, the staff generates options. A good COA can defeat feasible enemy COAs and ensure the unit remains flexible to execute branches or sequels. In an unconstrained planning environment, planners aim to develop several possible COAs. Depending on available time, commanders may limit the planning options, consistent with the commander's guidance. Options focus on enemy COAs arranged in order of their probable adoption.\\n\\n5-88. Brainstorming can be used for generating options. It requires extra time, imagination, and creativity, but it produces the widest range of options. The staff (and members of organizations outside the headquarters) remains unbiased and open-minded when developing proposed options.\\n\\n- 5-89. In  developing    \n",
       "35                            commanders  execute  it  because something planned has or has not been successful. In planning priorities, commanders plan a be-prepared mission after any on-order mission.\\n- 5-38. Once staff members have identified specified and implied tasks, they ensure understanding of each task's requirements and purpose. The staff then identifies one or two essential tasks. An essential task is a specified or implied task that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential tasks are always included in the unit's mission statement.\\n\\n## Review Available Assets and Identify Resource Shortfalls\\n\\n5-39. The commander and staff analyze the current task organization, command and support relationships, and status (including current capabilities and limitations) of all units, specifically identifying changes. This analysis also includes capabilities of civilian and military organizations (including joint and multinational) that  operate  within  their  unit's  assigned  area  or  are  otherwise  designated  to  support.  They  consider relationships  among  specified,  implied,  and  essential  tasks  and  available  assets.  Staff  officers  use  the capabilities and resources recorded in their running estimates as a starting point for their analysis. From this analysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all tasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commanders a rough comparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may request from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success. Staffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commanders to understand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets and relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\n\\n## Determine Constraints\\n\\n5-40. The  commander  and  staff  identify  any  constraints  placed  on  their  command.  A constraint is  a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the OPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example, may contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs, or in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a starting point to their analysis.   \n",
       "36                                                                                                                                                                     and facilitates continuous information sharing. Internally, this interaction allows the staff to receive guidance from the commander and resolve issues as they arise. Additionally,  it  provides  a  structure  and  framework  for  the  staff  to  work  collectively  and  produce  a coordinated plan. Externally, the MDMP facilitates information sharing among headquarters. As decisions, information, and staff products become available, the higher headquarters sends them to subordinates in WARNORDs.  WARNORDs  facilitate  parallel  planning  by  providing  critical  information  to  allow subordinates to start necessary planning and preparation activities.\\n\\n## Role of the Commander\\n\\n- 5-7. Commanders are the most important participants in the MDMP. Through their presence and actions, commanders  actively  drive  this  portion  of  the  operations  process.  More  than  simply  decision  makers, commanders use  their  experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  to  guide  staff  planning  efforts.  During  the MDMP, commanders focus their activities on understanding and visualizing the OE and describing their commander's visualization. While unable to devote all their time to the MDMP, commanders follow the status of the planning effort, participate during critical points of the process, provide guidance, and make decisions based on the detailed work of their staff. The commander issues guidance throughout the MDMP including, but not limited, to the following:\\n- · Upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission (initial planning guidance).\\n- · Following mission analysis (planning guidance for COA development, the desired end state and commander's intent).\\n- · Following COA development (revised planning guidance for COA analysis).\\n- · During COA approval (revised planning guidance to complete the plan).\\n- · Upon receipt of new information that invalidates assumptions or changes understanding of the OE.\\n\\n5-8. Commanders use their experience and judgment to add depth and clarity to their planning guidance. They ensure staffs understand the broad outline of their visualization while allowing the latitude necessary to explore different options. This guidance provides the basis for a detailed concept of operations without dictating the specifics of the final plan. As with their intent, the commander may modify planning guidance based on staff and subordinate input and changing conditions.\\n\\n5-9.

The chapter begins by discussing problem solving as related to decision making. This chapter establishes the base logic for all other problem-solving planning processes. The chapter concludes by discussing the seven-step process used in Army problem solving.\\n\\n## PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING\\n\\n- 3-1. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for leaders. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal, objective, or end state. Army problem solving is a form of decision making. It is a systematic approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the best solution, and implementing it. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to also do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success.\\n- 3-2. Not all problems require lengthy analysis to solve. For simple problems, leaders often make decisions quickly-sometimes  on  the  spot.  However,  for  complicated  problems  involving  a  variety  of  factors,  a systematic  problem-solving  approach  is  essential.  How  much  analysis  is  required  to  effectively  solve  a problem depends on the problem's complexity, the leader's experience, and amount of time available.\\n- 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally. (See FM 6-0 for more information on staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings.)\\n- 3-4. Problem solving is an art and science. It is a structured analytic process designed to ensure that all critical factors relevant to the problem are considered, and the relationships between variables are anticipated and accounted for in the solution. This ensures that the desired objective or end state is achieved in the most effective and efficient manner.\\n- 3-5. The art of problem solving involves subjective analysis of variables that, in many cases, cannot be easily measured. Leadership and morale, for example, are difficult to measure, but they   \n",

Prepared by DOD and approved by the President, the CPG fulfills the statutory requirement in Title 10, USC, Section 113 and provides written policy guidance on the preparation and review of campaign and contingency plans (including prioritization) to the CJCS and CCDRs for contingency planning. Contingency\\n\\nplans are branches of combatant command campaign plans. The CPG focuses the guidance given in the NSS and NDS and is the principal source document for the JSCP. (See paragraphs 2-31 through 2-33 for more information on contingency planning.)\\n\\n## Joint Strategic Campaign Plan\\n\\n- 2-16. The JSCP fulfills  the  CJCS's  statutory  responsibilities  in Title  10,  USC,  Section  153,  to  assist  the President and Secretary of Defense in providing for strategic direction to the joint force and implementing the strategic guidance in the NSS, NDS, NMS, and CPG. The JSCP provides this guidance to CCDRs, Service chiefs,  combat support agencies and applicable DOD agencies for preparation of plans based on current military capabilities, strategic guidance and contingency planning guidance identified to the CJCS in the CPG.\\n- 2-17. In addition to communicating to the CCMDs' specific planning guidance, the JSCP operationalizes the strategic vision described in the NMS and nests with the strategic direction delineated by the NSS, NDS, and GFMIG. The JSCP also provides integrated planning guidance and direction for planners to fulfill the CJCS's role as the global integrator.\\n\\n## Global Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-18. A global campaign plan is the primary means by which the CJCS or designated CCDRs arrange for unity of effort through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs) and functional responsibilities. Global campaign plans address the most  pressing  transregional  and  multifunctional  strategic  challenges  across  all  domains.  Each  global campaign plan has an assigned coordinating authority which is a CCDR with the primary responsibility for a global campaign plan. Contingency plans to a global campaign plan are called integrated contingency plans.\\n\\n## Functional Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-19.

This annex provides fundamental considerations, formats, and instructions for developing Annex B (Intelligence) to the base plan or order. This annex follows the five-paragraph attachment format.\\n- E-25. Commanders and staffs use Annex B (Intelligence) to describe how intelligence supports the concept of operations described in the base plan or order. The assistant chief of staff, intelligence (G-2) or battalion or brigade intelligence staff officer (S-2) develops Annex B (Intelligence).\\n- E-26. The  purpose  of  Annex  B  (Intelligence)  is  to  provide  detailed  information  and  intelligence  on  the characteristics of the OE and to direct intelligence and counterintelligence activities. Staffs use appendixes to provide detailed analysis of the OE and instructions from the various intelligence disciplines. (See figure E-2 on pages 232 through 236 for the format of Annex B.)\\n\\n## [CLASSIFICATION]\\n\\nPlace the classification at the top and bottom of every page of the attachments.

The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders. In the absence of the commander, key planning staff members must continually review progress and resolve questions and concerns with the commander at opportune times.\\n\\n- 1-137. The second pitfall is a lack of timely decisions by the commander necessary to continue effective planning. Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force.\\n- 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present. These plans often underestimate the scope of changes in directions that may occur and the results of second- and third-order effects. Even the most effective plans cannot anticipate all the unexpected events. Often, events overcome plans much sooner than anticipated. The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events.\\n- 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall  often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include. However, planners often respond to uncertainty by planning in more detail to try to account for every possibility. Often this overplanning results in an extremely detailed plan  that  does  not  survive  the  friction  of  the    \n",

       "45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               view capabilities in terms of those required to save, sustain, or enhance life, in that order of priority. Capabilities can refer to the ability of  local  authorities-those  of  the  host  nation,  aggressor  nation,  or  some  other  body-to  provide  the population with key functions or services, such as public administration, public safety, emergency services, and  food.  Primary  capabilities  include  those  areas  that  the  population  may  need  help  with  after  combat operations, such as public works and utilities, public health, economics, and commerce. Capabilities also refer to resources and services that can be contracted to support the military mission, such as interpreters, laundry services, construction materials, and equipment. The host nation or other nations might provide these resources and services.\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nA-32. Organizations are nonmilitary groups or institutions in an assigned area. They influence and interact with the population, the force, and each other. They generally have a hierarchical structure, defined goals, established operations, fixed facilities or meeting places, and a means of financial or logistic support. Some organizations may be indigenous to the area. These may include church groups, social organizations, patriotic or  service  organizations,  labor  unions,  criminal  organizations,  and  community  watch  groups.  Other organizations  may  come  from  outside  an  assigned  area.  Examples  of  these  include  multinational corporations, United Nations agencies, U.S. governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the International Red Cross.\\n\\nA-33. Operations  also  often  require  commanders  to  coordinate  with  international  organizations  and nongovernmental organizations. Commanders remain familiar with organizations operating in their assigned area. Relevant  information  includes  information  about  their  activities,  capabilities,  and  limitations. Situational understanding includes understanding how the activities of different organizations may affect\\n\\nmilitary  operations  and  how  military  operations  may  affect  these  organizations'  activities.  From  this, commanders can determine how organizations and military forces can work together toward common goals when necessary.\\n\\nA-34. At  certain  times,  every  echelon  of  command  will  interact  with  other  U.S.  agencies,  host-nation   \n",
       "46                                                                                                            total means of destructive and disruptive  force  that  a  military  unit/formation  can  apply  against  an  enemy  at  a  given  time  (JP  3-0). Designating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and priorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times during an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success at the time.\\n- 1-40. Commanders  resource  supporting  efforts  with  the  minimum  assets  necessary  to  accomplish  the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort in an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n- 1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the current tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when positioning  their  reserve.  While  commanders  can  assign  their  reserve  a  wide  variety  of  tasks,  through planning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n- 1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution as the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). Priorities of movement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support that commanders may use to weight the main effort.\\n\\n## ANTICIPATE EVENTS\\n\\n- 1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and coordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated uncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables the force to adapt to changing circumstances. Planning provides an informed forecast of how future events may unfold and anticipates transitions. It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in advance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and thirdorder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and threats.\\n\\n1-44   \n",

It includes providing forces and assets to subordinate commanders and establishing their command and support relationships. When task organizing their force, commanders visualize capabilities of units two echelons below them, based on their visualization of tasks to subordinates one echelon below them. Some assets are retained under the commander's immediate control to retain flexibility to exploit opportunities or counter threats.\\n- 1-36. Task organizing includes establishing command  or  support  relationships among  subordinate commanders. Army command relationships define command responsibility and authority.  Army  support relationships define the purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another. Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to task-organizing for any operation. (See FM 3-0 for a detailed discussion of joint, multinational, and Army command and support relationships.)\\n- 1-37. Task-organizing results in a task organization -a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a  particular  mission  (ADP  5-0).  The  unit's  task  organization  is  stipulated  in  the  base  plan  or  order  or addressed  in  Annex  A  (Task  Organization)  to  the  base  plan  or  order.  The  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or operation  order  (OPORD)  also  stipulates  changes  in  the  task  organization  by  phase.  During  execution, commanders modify the task organization as required based on the situation through fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs). (See Appendix E for task organization format and instructions.)\\n- 1-38.  Commanders prioritize efforts by designating a main effort, supporting efforts, and a reserve. The main effort is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a given point in time is most critical to overall mission success (ADP 3-0). A supporting effort is  a  designated subordinate unit with a mission that supports the success of the main effort (ADP 3-0). A reserve is  that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from action at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3-90).\\n- 1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power -the   \n",

U.S. doctrine and procedures for joint planning are applicable to multinational challenges. The general considerations for interaction with international organizations and partner-nation organizations are similar to those  for  interaction  with  U.S.  Government  departments  and  agencies.  (For  more  information  on  joint planning see JP-5-0.)\\n\\n## NATO PLANNING EFFORTS\\n\\n1-148. For NATO's operations, the United States and other NATO countries have developed and ratified an Allied joint doctrine hierarchy of publications outlining the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures that should be used during NATO operations. JFCs, their staffs, and subordinate forces should review and train with these publications prior to participating in NATO operations. For more information on NATO planning doctrine see AJP-5, Allied  Joint  Doctrine  for  the  Planning  of  Operations ,  or  APP-28, Tactical Planning for Land Forces .\\n\\n## MULTINATIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\n1-149. Multinational operations present unique challenges and demands throughout the planning process. Commanders  and  staffs  should  account  for  these  considerations  when  participating  in  multinational operations. The following are some of the considerations when planning multinational operations-\\n\\n- · Cultural and language issues.\\n- · Interoperability challenges.\\n- · National caveats on the use of respective forces.\\n- · The sharing of information and intelligence.\\n- · Rules of engagement.\\n- · Domestic and international laws.\\n- · Operational limitations on the use of contributed forces.\\n- · Weapons capabilities of participating nations.\\n- · Tactics of participating nations.\\n\\n(For more information on multinational operations planning, see FM 3-16.)\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n## Chapter 2\\n\\n## Planning and Operational Art\\n\\nThis chapter begins with a description of planning and the levels of warfare. A discussion of operational art follows. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the elements of operational art and the tools available to commanders and staffs in the application of operational art.\\n\\n## PLANNING AND THE LEVELS OF WARFARE\\n\\n- 2-1. Operational art spans a continuum-from strategic direction to   \n",
       "49                                                                                       require the command to reframe. As such, commanders and planning teams develop reframing indicators. A reframing indicator helps identify a condition in an OE that has changed or that could cause a shift in the problem such that a current operational  approach  may  no  longer  be  valid.  Although  many  reframing  indicators  will  not  meet  the requirement for the commander's critical information requirement (CCIRs), some reframing indicators could be included in the CCIRs if they represent something that would cause the commander to consider near-term reframing and potential redesign. An example of such information could be the impending alliance of a regional nation with the enemy that shifts the balance of power, even though an earlier assumption was that this alliance would not occur. Reframing indicators support the commander's ability to understand, learn, adapt, and reframe as necessary. Examples of such information include-\\n\\n- · Changes in the original problem statement.\\n- · Significant changes in threat composition.\\n- · Significant changes in the threat's approach.\\n- · Significant changes in friendly capability.\\n- · Higher echelon headquarters' policy changes or directives that change the desired end state.\\n- · Unexpected lack of friendly progress toward objectives.\\n- · Shifts in international support or domestic will.\\n- · Key assumptions prove to be invalid.\\n\\n## ASSESSMENT PLAN\\n\\n4-99. The assessment plan incorporates reframing criteria in the form of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) that are used to evaluate completed tasks, achieved objectives, and obtained end-state conditions. An effective assessment plan incorporates the logic used to build the plan. The logic as to why the commander believes the actions in the plan will produce the desired results is an important consideration when developing the assessment plan. Recording and understanding this logic during ADM helps the staff recommend the appropriate indicators for assessing the operation. It also helps the commander and staff determine if they need to reframe the problem if assumptions prove false or the logic behind the plan appears flawed as operations progress. (See Chapter 8 for details on building an assessment plan.)\\n\\n## Chapter 5\\n\\n## The Military Decision-Making Process\\n\\nThis chapter defines and describes the military decision-making process (MDMP). It provides an overview of the process followed by a detailed explanation for conducting each step of the MDMP. The chapter concludes with techniques for modifying the MDMP in a time-constrained   \n",
       "50                                                                                                                                                                               The staff's experience, cohesiveness, and level of rest or stress.\\n\\n- · Whether or not to conduct ADM.\\n- · How to abbreviate the MDMP if under a time constraint.\\n- · Guidance on when to use the rapid decision-making and synchronization process (RDSP) during execution.\\n- · Planning team composition.\\n- · Time required to position critical elements, including command and control nodes for upcoming operations.\\n- · Which outside agencies and organizations to contact and incorporate into the planning process.\\n- · Other preparations the commander, staff, or subordinate units need to conduct before beginning planning.\\n\\n5-20. The initial assessment also helps determine when to begin certain actions to ensure forces are ready and in position before execution. This may require the commander to direct subordinates to start necessary movements, conduct task organization changes, begin information collection, and execute other preparation activities before completing the plan.\\n\\n- 5-21. Commanders and staffs allocate available planning time to prioritize different steps of the MDMP based on the given situation. For example, when conducting initial planning for a new operation, more time may be allocated to mission analysis than the other steps to develop a better understanding of the problem and OE. Time allocations will vary based on a variety of factors such as experience of the planning staff, products already available, and commander involvement. Table 5-1 depicts an example planning time allocation.\\n\\nTable 5-1. Planning time allocation\\n\\nNote. The initial time allocation is made during Step 1 to guide initial planning efforts. The commander and staff continue to adjust it as they gain a better understanding of time available during the following steps of the MDMP.\\n\\n5-22. Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. Time, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The commander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum time for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of two-thirds  of  available  time  for  subordinate  units  to  conduct  their  planning  and  preparation.  This  leaves one-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the other  two-thirds  for  their  own  preparation.  Commanders  should  consider    \n",

In addition to planning, problem solving includes implementing the planned solution (execution), learning from the implementation of the solution (assessment), and modifying or developing a new solution as required. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success. (See Chapter 3 on Army problem solving.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, MITIGATE, AND ACCEPT RISK\\n\\n- 1-29. Risk-the  exposure  of  someone  or  something  valued  to  danger,  harm,  or  loss-is  inherent  in  all operations. Because risk is part of all military operations, it cannot be avoided. Risk may range for resource shortfall or a course of actions that exposed a friendly force's flank. Identifying, mitigating, and accepting risk is a function of command and a key consideration during planning.\\n- 1-30. During  planning,  commanders  and  staffs  analyze  risk  in  collaboration  with  subordinates  and  their higher-level headquarters to help determine what level of risk exists and how to mitigate it. When considering how much risk to accept with a course of action, commanders consider risk to the force and risk to the mission against the perceived benefit. They apply judgment with regards to the importance of an objective, time available, and anticipated cost. Commanders balance the tension between protecting the force and accepting and managing risks that must be taken to accomplish their mission. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk as an element of operational art.)\\n\\n## DIRECT, COORDINATE, AND SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS\\n\\n- 1-31. Plans  and  orders  are  the  principal  means  commanders  use  to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize actions. They also inform those outside the unit how to cooperate and provide support. Effective plans and orders direct subordinates by stating what is required (the task) and why (the purpose). They leave much of the how (the method) up to subordinates.\\n- 1-32. Plans and orders contain control measures to coordinate and synchronize action. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions (ADP 6-0). Control measures aid in coordinating forces without imposing needless restrictions on their  freedom  of  action.  Commanders  use   \n",

       "55                                                                                 higher echelon commanders and unified action partners in defining problems and developing common expectations regarding resolution. This is vital to develop an effective operational approach to solve or manage identified problems. Here is an example of an initial problem statement based on the Freeland scenario.\\n\\nProblem statement: Aggressland forces are escalating their offensive activities against Freeland to destabilize the democratic government in Freeland and expand their regional hegemony. For more than fifty years, Freeland has maintained diplomatic, information, military, and economic autonomy. Other regional nations and world democracies have provided limited diplomatic and military support to Freeland, but these efforts have been insufficient to deter border incursions from Aggressland. Freeland is a diplomatic and economic partner to the U.S., but military partnership has been limited due to potentially negative international policy impacts. Freeland's military and civil defense forces are limited in size but are relatively modern. Aggressland has maintained a long-standing strategic rivalry with the U.S. To maintain deterrence and regional access, prevent crisis in Freeland, and bolster regional stability, the U.S. must be prepared for armed conflict in support of the defense of Freeland.\\n\\n- 4-63. Commanders and planners continue to develop the problem narrative as they learn more about an OE and develop an operational approach. For example, the small size of the Freeland defense force is a significant issue,  but  not  the  only  one.  After  discussing  the  problem  narrative  with  the  commander  and  others,  the planning team may expand the narrative by including problems associated with-\\n- · Availability of potential ports or intermediate staging locations for military forces.\\n- · Potential for special purpose attacks against regional partners, forward deployed military forces, or sustainment nodes.\\n- · Reinforcement of Freeland armed forces.\\n- · Influence of the adversary on other regional neighbors of Freeland.\\n- · Established adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities surrounding Freeland.\\n\\n## DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH\\n\\n4-64. Once commanders and planners agree on the problem or set of problems, they develop ways to address them. They do this by developing an operational approach-a description of the broad actions the force must take  to  transform  current  conditions  into  those  desired  at  end  state.  An  operational  approach  is  the commander's visualization of what needs to be done to solve or manage identified problems   \n",

This annex provides considerations, formats, and instructions for developing Annex L (Information Collection),  also  referred  to  as  collection  management  or  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance operations.  Information  collection  uses  a  mix of  ground, air,  and  space  collection  platforms  at  the  joint, operational, and strategic levels, articulated in Army plans and orders.

Leaders understand the status of their Soldiers' morale, their experience and training, and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. They determine all available resources and assess their capabilities. This  includes  troops  attached  to,  or  in  direct  support  of,  the  unit.  The  assessment  includes  knowing  the strength and status of unit equipment. It also includes understanding the full array of assets in support of the unit.  Leaders  know,  for  example,  how  much  indirect  fire,  space,  cyberspace,  or  information  operation capabilities will become available, when they are available, and they will know the best assets to inform planning. Leaders should consider any new limitations based on the level of training or recent operations.\\n\\n## TIME AVAILABLE\\n\\nA-26. Leaders not only appreciate how much time is available, but they also understand the time and space aspects  of  preparing,  moving,  fighting,  and  sustaining.  They  view  their  own  tasks  and  enemy  actions  in relation to time. They know how long it takes under different conditions to prepare for certain tasks (such as orders production, rehearsals, and subordinate element preparations). Leaders should remain mindful of the extended  timelines  generally  associated  with  achieving  information  effects  such  as  achieving  cognitive effects on enemy forces or creating and executing desired offensive cyberspace effects. Most importantly, leaders monitor the time available. As events occur, they assess their impact on the unit timeline and update previous timelines for their subordinates. Timelines list all events that affect the unit and its subordinate elements.\\n\\n## CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nA-27. Military  operations  are  rarely  conducted  in  uninhabited  areas.  Units  are  often  surrounded  by noncombatants. These noncombatants may include residents within the assigned area, local officials, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Leaders strive to understand the behaviors and attitudes of populations, to include discerning if they are hostile, friendly, or neutral to friendly forces and how they may be influenced. Based on information from higher echelon headquarters and their own knowledge and judgment, leaders identify civil considerations that affect their mission. Commanders typically analyze civil considerations using six factors known collectively as ASCOPE: areas,   \n",

Contingency plans are often phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable to the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termination criteria. They address military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n- 2-33. Planning for a contingency encompasses the activities associated with the development of plans for the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces and resources in response to potential crises  identified  in  joint  strategic  planning documents.  The  level  of  planning  detail of contingency plans varies based on guidance and changes in the security environment. Planning details range from level 1 to level 4 as discussed in paragraphs 2-34 through 2-37. Although listed sequentially, during a crisis they may be conducted concurrently or compressed depending on the situation and conditions. (See JP 5-0 for more information on contingency planning and associated levels of planning detail.)\\n\\n## Level 1-Commander's Estimate\\n\\n- 2-34. The commander's estimate is the commander's initial assessment in which options are provided in a concise  statement  that  defines  who,  what,  when,  where,  why,  and  how  the  course  of  action  will  be implemented (JP 5-0). The commander's estimate, at planning level 1, involves the least amount of detail and focuses on producing multiple courses of action (COAs) to address a contingency. The product for this level can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander's estimate, or a memorandum with a required force  list.  The  commander's  estimate  provides  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  military  COAs  to  meet  a potential contingency.\\n\\n## Level 2-Base Plan\\n\\n- 2-35. A base plan, at planning level 2, describes the concept of operations, major forces, schemes of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes. A base plan may contain alternatives, including flexible deterrent operations, to provide flexibility in addressing a contingency as it develops or to aid in developing the situation.\\n\\n## Level 3-Concept Plan\\n\\n- 2-36.

METT-TC (I) represents the mission variables leaders use to analyze and understand a situation in relationship to the unit's mission. Informational considerations are those aspects of the human, information and physical dimensions that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, use, act upon, and  are  impacted  by  information  (FM  3-0).  Informational  considerations  is  expressed  as  a  parenthetical variable in that it is not an independent variable, but an important component of each variable of METT-TC that leaders pay particular attention to when developing understanding of a situation. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the mission variables.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND, AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS\\n\\n- 1-26. Planning  helps  leaders  better  understand  and  identify  problems  and  develop  solutions  to  solve  or manage those problems. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or objective. In a broad sense, a problem exists when an individual becomes aware of a significant difference between what is currently observed or occurring in the environment, and what is desired. In the context of operations, an operational problem is the issue or set of issues that impede commanders from achieving their desired  end  state.  (See  paragraph  1-53  for  further  discussion  on  identification  of  problems  and  problem solving.) Identification of the actual problem to solve is critical to successful planning. Misidentification of the problem often leads to an ineffective plan and operational approach and time critical to subordinates for development of their plans.\\n- 1-27. Throughout operations, Army leaders face various problems, requiring unique and creative solutions. Not all problems require the same level of planning. Leaders often identify simple problems immediately and quickly decide on a solution-sometimes on the spot. However, planning is critical when a problem is a set of interrelated issues, and the solution to each issue affects the others. For unfamiliar situations, planning offers ways to solve the complete set of problems. In general, the more complex a situation is, the more important and involved the planning effort becomes.\\n\\n- 1-28. Just as planning is only part of the operations   \n",

Commanders and staffs use Annex P (Host-Nation Support) to describe how sustainment operations support the concept of operations described in the base plan or order. The G-4 or S-4 is the staff officer responsible for Annex P (Host-Nation Support).\\n- E-59. Host-nation support is the civil and military assistance provided by the host nation to the forces located in or transiting through that host-nation's territory. Efficient use of available host-nation support can greatly aid forces and augment the deployed sustainment structure. (See figure E-15 on pages 307 through 311 for the Annex P format.)\\n\\n## [CLASSIFICATION]\\n\\nPlace the classification at the top and bottom of every page of the attachments.

       "64  the assessment is also largely subjective. Planners may also consider time and space when developing force ratios to more accurately assess where and when engagements could occur and how to determine appropriate force ratios.\\n\\n5-84. Planners first compare tangible factors of friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses, and vice versa, for  combat  maneuver  units  and  functional  and  multifunctional  units,  as  necessary.  From  this  objective analysis, planners produce force ratios which highlight advantages or vulnerabilities for each force that may be exploited or may need additional considerations or protection. These comparisons provide planners insight into effective force employment recommendations. (Refer to FM 3-0 for more information on the dynamics of combat power.)\\n\\n5-85. After computing force ratios, the staff analyzes the intangible aspects of combat power. A technique for this analysis is conducting a subjective comparison of friendly strengths and enemy weaknesses for each dynamic of combat power. The resulting analysis can be beneficial by either reinforcing or offsetting the advantages and vulnerabilities identified by the objective analysis. Often, the intangible factors are more\\n\\nimportant than the number of tanks or tubes of artillery. This can lead to planner's effectively identifying decision points for the effective employment of forces. (See table 5-4 for an example of a relative combat power assessment.)\\n\\nTable 5-4. Example relative combat power assessment\\n\\n5-86. In troop-to-task analysis for stability and defense support of civil authorities, staffs determine relative combat power by comparing available resources to specified or implied stability or defense support of civil authorities tasks. This analysis provides insights into available options and needed resources.\\n\\n## Generate Options\\n\\n5-87. Based on the commander's guidance and the results of the initial relative combat power assessment, the staff generates options. A good COA can defeat feasible enemy COAs and ensure the unit remains flexible to execute branches or sequels. In an unconstrained planning environment, planners aim to develop several possible COAs. Depending on available time, commanders may limit the planning options, consistent with the commander's guidance. Options focus on enemy COAs arranged in order of their probable adoption.\\n\\n5-88. Brainstorming can be used for generating options. It requires extra time, imagination, and creativity, but it produces the widest range of options. The staff (and members of organizations outside the headquarters) remains unbiased and open-minded when developing proposed options.\\n\\n- 5-89. In  developing    \n",
       "65                            commanders  execute  it  because something planned has or has not been successful. In planning priorities, commanders plan a be-prepared mission after any on-order mission.\\n- 5-38. Once staff members have identified specified and implied tasks, they ensure understanding of each task's requirements and purpose. The staff then identifies one or two essential tasks. An essential task is a specified or implied task that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential tasks are always included in the unit's mission statement.\\n\\n## Review Available Assets and Identify Resource Shortfalls\\n\\n5-39. The commander and staff analyze the current task organization, command and support relationships, and status (including current capabilities and limitations) of all units, specifically identifying changes. This analysis also includes capabilities of civilian and military organizations (including joint and multinational) that  operate  within  their  unit's  assigned  area  or  are  otherwise  designated  to  support.  They  consider relationships  among  specified,  implied,  and  essential  tasks  and  available  assets.  Staff  officers  use  the capabilities and resources recorded in their running estimates as a starting point for their analysis. From this analysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all tasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commanders a rough comparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may request from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success. Staffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commanders to understand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets and relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\n\\n## Determine Constraints\\n\\n5-40. The  commander  and  staff  identify  any  constraints  placed  on  their  command.  A constraint is  a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the OPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example, may contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs, or in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a starting point to their analysis.   \n",
       "66                                                                                                                                                                     and facilitates continuous information sharing. Internally, this interaction allows the staff to receive guidance from the commander and resolve issues as they arise. Additionally,  it  provides  a  structure  and  framework  for  the  staff  to  work  collectively  and  produce  a coordinated plan. Externally, the MDMP facilitates information sharing among headquarters. As decisions, information, and staff products become available, the higher headquarters sends them to subordinates in WARNORDs.  WARNORDs  facilitate  parallel  planning  by  providing  critical  information  to  allow subordinates to start necessary planning and preparation activities.\\n\\n## Role of the Commander\\n\\n- 5-7. Commanders are the most important participants in the MDMP. Through their presence and actions, commanders  actively  drive  this  portion  of  the  operations  process.  More  than  simply  decision  makers, commanders use  their  experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  to  guide  staff  planning  efforts.  During  the MDMP, commanders focus their activities on understanding and visualizing the OE and describing their commander's visualization. While unable to devote all their time to the MDMP, commanders follow the status of the planning effort, participate during critical points of the process, provide guidance, and make decisions based on the detailed work of their staff. The commander issues guidance throughout the MDMP including, but not limited, to the following:\\n- · Upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission (initial planning guidance).\\n- · Following mission analysis (planning guidance for COA development, the desired end state and commander's intent).\\n- · Following COA development (revised planning guidance for COA analysis).\\n- · During COA approval (revised planning guidance to complete the plan).\\n- · Upon receipt of new information that invalidates assumptions or changes understanding of the OE.\\n\\n5-8. Commanders use their experience and judgment to add depth and clarity to their planning guidance. They ensure staffs understand the broad outline of their visualization while allowing the latitude necessary to explore different options. This guidance provides the basis for a detailed concept of operations without dictating the specifics of the final plan. As with their intent, the commander may modify planning guidance based on staff and subordinate input and changing conditions.\\n\\n5-9.

The chapter begins by discussing problem solving as related to decision making. This chapter establishes the base logic for all other problem-solving planning processes. The chapter concludes by discussing the seven-step process used in Army problem solving.\\n\\n## PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING\\n\\n- 3-1. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for leaders. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal, objective, or end state. Army problem solving is a form of decision making. It is a systematic approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the best solution, and implementing it. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to also do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success.\\n- 3-2. Not all problems require lengthy analysis to solve. For simple problems, leaders often make decisions quickly-sometimes  on  the  spot.  However,  for  complicated  problems  involving  a  variety  of  factors,  a systematic  problem-solving  approach  is  essential.  How  much  analysis  is  required  to  effectively  solve  a problem depends on the problem's complexity, the leader's experience, and amount of time available.\\n- 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally. (See FM 6-0 for more information on staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings.)\\n- 3-4. Problem solving is an art and science. It is a structured analytic process designed to ensure that all critical factors relevant to the problem are considered, and the relationships between variables are anticipated and accounted for in the solution. This ensures that the desired objective or end state is achieved in the most effective and efficient manner.\\n- 3-5. The art of problem solving involves subjective analysis of variables that, in many cases, cannot be easily measured. Leadership and morale, for example, are difficult to measure, but they   \n",

Prepared by DOD and approved by the President, the CPG fulfills the statutory requirement in Title 10, USC, Section 113 and provides written policy guidance on the preparation and review of campaign and contingency plans (including prioritization) to the CJCS and CCDRs for contingency planning. Contingency\\n\\nplans are branches of combatant command campaign plans. The CPG focuses the guidance given in the NSS and NDS and is the principal source document for the JSCP. (See paragraphs 2-31 through 2-33 for more information on contingency planning.)\\n\\n## Joint Strategic Campaign Plan\\n\\n- 2-16. The JSCP fulfills  the  CJCS's  statutory  responsibilities  in Title  10,  USC,  Section  153,  to  assist  the President and Secretary of Defense in providing for strategic direction to the joint force and implementing the strategic guidance in the NSS, NDS, NMS, and CPG. The JSCP provides this guidance to CCDRs, Service chiefs,  combat support agencies and applicable DOD agencies for preparation of plans based on current military capabilities, strategic guidance and contingency planning guidance identified to the CJCS in the CPG.\\n- 2-17. In addition to communicating to the CCMDs' specific planning guidance, the JSCP operationalizes the strategic vision described in the NMS and nests with the strategic direction delineated by the NSS, NDS, and GFMIG. The JSCP also provides integrated planning guidance and direction for planners to fulfill the CJCS's role as the global integrator.\\n\\n## Global Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-18. A global campaign plan is the primary means by which the CJCS or designated CCDRs arrange for unity of effort through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs) and functional responsibilities. Global campaign plans address the most  pressing  transregional  and  multifunctional  strategic  challenges  across  all  domains.  Each  global campaign plan has an assigned coordinating authority which is a CCDR with the primary responsibility for a global campaign plan.

This annex provides fundamental considerations, formats, and instructions for developing Annex B (Intelligence) to the base plan or order. This annex follows the five-paragraph attachment format.\\n- E-25. Commanders and staffs use Annex B (Intelligence) to describe how intelligence supports the concept of operations described in the base plan or order. The assistant chief of staff, intelligence (G-2) or battalion or brigade intelligence staff officer (S-2) develops Annex B (Intelligence).\\n- E-26. The  purpose  of  Annex  B  (Intelligence)  is  to  provide  detailed  information  and  intelligence  on  the characteristics of the OE and to direct intelligence and counterintelligence activities. Staffs use appendixes to provide detailed analysis of the OE and instructions from the various intelligence disciplines.

The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders. In the absence of the commander, key planning staff members must continually review progress and resolve questions and concerns with the commander at opportune times.\\n\\n- 1-137. The second pitfall is a lack of timely decisions by the commander necessary to continue effective planning. Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force.\\n- 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present. These plans often underestimate the scope of changes in directions that may occur and the results of second- and third-order effects. Even the most effective plans cannot anticipate all the unexpected events. Often, events overcome plans much sooner than anticipated. The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events.\\n- 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall  often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include. However, planners often respond to uncertainty by planning in more detail to try to account for every possibility. Often this overplanning results in an extremely detailed plan  that  does  not  survive  the  friction  of  the    \n",

Capabilities can refer to the ability of  local  authorities-those  of  the  host  nation,  aggressor  nation,  or  some  other  body-to  provide  the population with key functions or services, such as public administration, public safety, emergency services, and  food.  Primary  capabilities  include  those  areas  that  the  population  may  need  help  with  after  combat operations, such as public works and utilities, public health, economics, and commerce. Capabilities also refer to resources and services that can be contracted to support the military mission, such as interpreters, laundry services, construction materials, and equipment. The host nation or other nations might provide these resources and services.\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nA-32. Organizations are nonmilitary groups or institutions in an assigned area. They influence and interact with the population, the force, and each other. They generally have a hierarchical structure, defined goals, established operations, fixed facilities or meeting places, and a means of financial or logistic support. Some organizations may be indigenous to the area. These may include church groups, social organizations, patriotic or  service  organizations,  labor  unions,  criminal  organizations,  and  community  watch  groups.  Other organizations  may  come  from  outside  an  assigned  area.  Examples  of  these  include  multinational corporations, United Nations agencies, U.S. governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the International Red Cross.\\n\\nA-33. Operations  also  often  require  commanders  to  coordinate  with  international  organizations  and nongovernmental organizations. Commanders remain familiar with organizations operating in their assigned area. Relevant  information  includes  information  about  their  activities,  capabilities,  and  limitations. Situational understanding includes understanding how the activities of different organizations may affect\\n\\nmilitary  operations  and  how  military  operations  may  affect  these  organizations'  activities.  From  this, commanders can determine how organizations and military forces can work together toward common goals when necessary.\\n\\nA-34. At  certain  times,  every  echelon  of  command  will  interact  with  other  U.S.  agencies,  host-nation   \n",
       "76                                                                                                            total means of destructive and disruptive  force  that  a  military  unit/formation  can  apply  against  an  enemy  at  a  given  time  (JP  3-0). Designating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and priorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times during an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success at the time.\\n- 1-40. Commanders  resource  supporting  efforts  with  the  minimum  assets  necessary  to  accomplish  the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort in an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n- 1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the current tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when positioning  their  reserve.  While  commanders  can  assign  their  reserve  a  wide  variety  of  tasks,  through planning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n- 1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution as the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). Priorities of movement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support that commanders may use to weight the main effort.\\n\\n## ANTICIPATE EVENTS\\n\\n- 1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and coordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated uncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables the force to adapt to changing circumstances. Planning provides an informed forecast of how future events may unfold and anticipates transitions. It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in advance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and thirdorder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and threats.\\n\\n1-44   \n",

It includes providing forces and assets to subordinate commanders and establishing their command and support relationships. When task organizing their force, commanders visualize capabilities of units two echelons below them, based on their visualization of tasks to subordinates one echelon below them. Some assets are retained under the commander's immediate control to retain flexibility to exploit opportunities or counter threats.\\n- 1-36. Task organizing includes establishing command  or  support  relationships among  subordinate commanders. Army command relationships define command responsibility and authority.  Army  support relationships define the purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another. Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to task-organizing for any operation. (See FM 3-0 for a detailed discussion of joint, multinational, and Army command and support relationships.)\\n- 1-37. Task-organizing results in a task organization -a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a  particular  mission  (ADP  5-0).  The  unit's  task  organization  is  stipulated  in  the  base  plan  or  order  or addressed  in  Annex  A  (Task  Organization)  to  the  base  plan  or  order.  The  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or operation  order  (OPORD)  also  stipulates  changes  in  the  task  organization  by  phase.  During  execution, commanders modify the task organization as required based on the situation through fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs). (See Appendix E for task organization format and instructions.)\\n- 1-38.  Commanders prioritize efforts by designating a main effort, supporting efforts, and a reserve. The main effort is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a given point in time is most critical to overall mission success (ADP 3-0). A supporting effort is  a  designated subordinate unit with a mission that supports the success of the main effort (ADP 3-0). A reserve is  that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from action at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3-90).\\n- 1-39. The main effort is weighted with the preponderance of combat power -the   \n",

U.S. doctrine and procedures for joint planning are applicable to multinational challenges. The general considerations for interaction with international organizations and partner-nation organizations are similar to those  for  interaction  with  U.S.  Government  departments  and  agencies.  (For  more  information  on  joint planning see JP-5-0.)\\n\\n## NATO PLANNING EFFORTS\\n\\n1-148. For NATO's operations, the United States and other NATO countries have developed and ratified an Allied joint doctrine hierarchy of publications outlining the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures that should be used during NATO operations. JFCs, their staffs, and subordinate forces should review and train with these publications prior to participating in NATO operations. For more information on NATO planning doctrine see AJP-5, Allied  Joint  Doctrine  for  the  Planning  of  Operations ,  or  APP-28, Tactical Planning for Land Forces .\\n\\n## MULTINATIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\n1-149. Multinational operations present unique challenges and demands throughout the planning process. Commanders  and  staffs  should  account  for  these  considerations  when  participating  in  multinational operations. The following are some of the considerations when planning multinational operations-\\n\\n- · Cultural and language issues.\\n- · Interoperability challenges.\\n- · National caveats on the use of respective forces.\\n- · The sharing of information and intelligence.\\n- · Rules of engagement.\\n- · Domestic and international laws.\\n- · Operational limitations on the use of contributed forces.\\n- · Weapons capabilities of participating nations.\\n- · Tactics of participating nations.\\n\\n(For more information on multinational operations planning, see FM 3-16.)\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n## Chapter 2\\n\\n## Planning and Operational Art\\n\\nThis chapter begins with a description of planning and the levels of warfare.

A reframing indicator helps identify a condition in an OE that has changed or that could cause a shift in the problem such that a current operational  approach  may  no  longer  be  valid.  Although  many  reframing  indicators  will  not  meet  the requirement for the commander's critical information requirement (CCIRs), some reframing indicators could be included in the CCIRs if they represent something that would cause the commander to consider near-term reframing and potential redesign. An example of such information could be the impending alliance of a regional nation with the enemy that shifts the balance of power, even though an earlier assumption was that this alliance would not occur. Reframing indicators support the commander's ability to understand, learn, adapt, and reframe as necessary. Examples of such information include-\\n\\n- · Changes in the original problem statement.\\n- · Significant changes in threat composition.\\n- · Significant changes in the threat's approach.\\n- · Significant changes in friendly capability.\\n- · Higher echelon headquarters' policy changes or directives that change the desired end state.\\n- · Unexpected lack of friendly progress toward objectives.\\n- · Shifts in international support or domestic will.\\n- · Key assumptions prove to be invalid.\\n\\n## ASSESSMENT PLAN\\n\\n4-99. The assessment plan incorporates reframing criteria in the form of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) that are used to evaluate completed tasks, achieved objectives, and obtained end-state conditions. An effective assessment plan incorporates the logic used to build the plan. The logic as to why the commander believes the actions in the plan will produce the desired results is an important consideration when developing the assessment plan. Recording and understanding this logic during ADM helps the staff recommend the appropriate indicators for assessing the operation. It also helps the commander and staff determine if they need to reframe the problem if assumptions prove false or the logic behind the plan appears flawed as operations progress. (See Chapter 8 for details on building an assessment plan.)\\n\\n## Chapter 5\\n\\n## The Military Decision-Making Process\\n\\nThis chapter defines and describes the military decision-making process (MDMP). It provides an overview of the process followed by a detailed explanation for conducting each step of the MDMP. The chapter concludes with techniques for modifying the MDMP in a time-constrained   \n",

The initial assessment also helps determine when to begin certain actions to ensure forces are ready and in position before execution. This may require the commander to direct subordinates to start necessary movements, conduct task organization changes, begin information collection, and execute other preparation activities before completing the plan.\\n\\n- 5-21. Commanders and staffs allocate available planning time to prioritize different steps of the MDMP based on the given situation. For example, when conducting initial planning for a new operation, more time may be allocated to mission analysis than the other steps to develop a better understanding of the problem and OE. Time allocations will vary based on a variety of factors such as experience of the planning staff, products already available, and commander involvement. Table 5-1 depicts an example planning time allocation.\\n\\nTable 5-1. Planning time allocation\\n\\nNote. The initial time allocation is made during Step 1 to guide initial planning efforts. The commander and staff continue to adjust it as they gain a better understanding of time available during the following steps of the MDMP.\\n\\n5-22. Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. Time, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The commander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum time for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of two-thirds  of  available  time  for  subordinate  units  to  conduct  their  planning  and  preparation.  This  leaves one-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the other  two-thirds  for  their  own  preparation.  Commanders  should  consider    \n",

In addition to planning, problem solving includes implementing the planned solution (execution), learning from the implementation of the solution (assessment), and modifying or developing a new solution as required. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success. (See Chapter 3 on Army problem solving.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, MITIGATE, AND ACCEPT RISK\\n\\n- 1-29. Risk-the  exposure  of  someone  or  something  valued  to  danger,  harm,  or  loss-is  inherent  in  all operations. Because risk is part of all military operations, it cannot be avoided. Risk may range for resource shortfall or a course of actions that exposed a friendly force's flank. Identifying, mitigating, and accepting risk is a function of command and a key consideration during planning.\\n- 1-30. During  planning,  commanders  and  staffs  analyze  risk  in  collaboration  with  subordinates  and  their higher-level headquarters to help determine what level of risk exists and how to mitigate it. When considering how much risk to accept with a course of action, commanders consider risk to the force and risk to the mission against the perceived benefit. They apply judgment with regards to the importance of an objective, time available, and anticipated cost. Commanders balance the tension between protecting the force and accepting and managing risks that must be taken to accomplish their mission. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk as an element of operational art.)\\n\\n## DIRECT, COORDINATE, AND SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS\\n\\n- 1-31. Plans  and  orders  are  the  principal  means  commanders  use  to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize actions. They also inform those outside the unit how to cooperate and provide support. Effective plans and orders direct subordinates by stating what is required (the task) and why (the purpose). They leave much of the how (the method) up to subordinates.\\n- 1-32. Plans and orders contain control measures to coordinate and synchronize action. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions (ADP 6-0). Control measures aid in coordinating forces without imposing needless restrictions on their  freedom  of  action.  Commanders  use   \n",

       "85                                                                                 higher echelon commanders and unified action partners in defining problems and developing common expectations regarding resolution. This is vital to develop an effective operational approach to solve or manage identified problems. Here is an example of an initial problem statement based on the Freeland scenario.\\n\\nProblem statement: Aggressland forces are escalating their offensive activities against Freeland to destabilize the democratic government in Freeland and expand their regional hegemony. For more than fifty years, Freeland has maintained diplomatic, information, military, and economic autonomy. Other regional nations and world democracies have provided limited diplomatic and military support to Freeland, but these efforts have been insufficient to deter border incursions from Aggressland. Freeland is a diplomatic and economic partner to the U.S., but military partnership has been limited due to potentially negative international policy impacts. Freeland's military and civil defense forces are limited in size but are relatively modern. Aggressland has maintained a long-standing strategic rivalry with the U.S. To maintain deterrence and regional access, prevent crisis in Freeland, and bolster regional stability, the U.S. must be prepared for armed conflict in support of the defense of Freeland.\\n\\n- 4-63. Commanders and planners continue to develop the problem narrative as they learn more about an OE and develop an operational approach. For example, the small size of the Freeland defense force is a significant issue,  but  not  the  only  one.  After  discussing  the  problem  narrative  with  the  commander  and  others,  the planning team may expand the narrative by including problems associated with-\\n- · Availability of potential ports or intermediate staging locations for military forces.\\n- · Potential for special purpose attacks against regional partners, forward deployed military forces, or sustainment nodes.\\n- · Reinforcement of Freeland armed forces.\\n- · Influence of the adversary on other regional neighbors of Freeland.\\n- · Established adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities surrounding Freeland.\\n\\n## DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH\\n\\n4-64. Once commanders and planners agree on the problem or set of problems, they develop ways to address them. They do this by developing an operational approach-a description of the broad actions the force must take  to  transform  current  conditions  into  those  desired  at  end  state.  An  operational  approach  is  the commander's visualization of what needs to be done to solve or manage identified problems   \n",

Information  collection  uses  a  mix of  ground, air,  and  space  collection  platforms  at  the  joint, operational, and strategic levels, articulated in Army plans and orders. This annex provides a format that can be modified to meet the requirements of the base order and operations. Paragraphs throughout this annex are applicable to all formation types, unless annotated. This annex follows the five-paragraph attachment format.\\n\\nE-50. The information collection annex clearly describes how information collection activities support the offensive,  defensive,  and  stability  operations  or  defense  support  of  civil  authorities  tasks  throughout  the conduct of the operations described in the base order. It synchronizes activities in time, space, and purpose to achieve objectives and accomplish the commander's intent for information collection (including military intelligence disciplines). The G-3 or S-3, in conjunction with the G-2 or S-2, is responsible for this annex. (See figure E-12 on pages 291 through 296 for the Annex L format.)\\n\\n## [CLASSIFICATION]\\n\\nPlace the classification at the top and bottom of every page of the attachments. Place the classification marking  at  the  front  of  each  paragraph  and  subparagraph  in  parentheses.  Refer  to  AR  380-5  and DODM 5200.01V2 for classification and release marking instructions.\\n\\nCopy ## of ## copies Issuing headquarters Place of issue Date-time group of signature\\n\\nMessage reference number\\n\\nInclude  the  full  heading  if  attachment  is  distributed  separately  from  the  base  order  or  higher-level   \n",
       "89                                                                                                                                                                              the most important aspect of mission analysis is determining the combat power of one's own force. Leaders understand the status of their Soldiers' morale, their experience and training, and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. They determine all available resources and assess their capabilities. This  includes  troops  attached  to,  or  in  direct  support  of,  the  unit.  The  assessment  includes  knowing  the strength and status of unit equipment. It also includes understanding the full array of assets in support of the unit.  Leaders  know,  for  example,  how  much  indirect  fire,  space,  cyberspace,  or  information  operation capabilities will become available, when they are available, and they will know the best assets to inform planning. Leaders should consider any new limitations based on the level of training or recent operations.\\n\\n## TIME AVAILABLE\\n\\nA-26. Leaders not only appreciate how much time is available, but they also understand the time and space aspects  of  preparing,  moving,  fighting,  and  sustaining.  They  view  their  own  tasks  and  enemy  actions  in relation to time. They know how long it takes under different conditions to prepare for certain tasks (such as orders production, rehearsals, and subordinate element preparations). Leaders should remain mindful of the extended  timelines  generally  associated  with  achieving  information  effects  such  as  achieving  cognitive effects on enemy forces or creating and executing desired offensive cyberspace effects. Most importantly, leaders monitor the time available. As events occur, they assess their impact on the unit timeline and update previous timelines for their subordinates. Timelines list all events that affect the unit and its subordinate elements.\\n\\n## CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nA-27. Military  operations  are  rarely  conducted  in  uninhabited  areas.  Units  are  often  surrounded  by noncombatants. These noncombatants may include residents within the assigned area, local officials, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Leaders strive to understand the behaviors and attitudes of populations, to include discerning if they are hostile, friendly, or neutral to friendly forces and how they may be influenced. Based on information from higher echelon headquarters and their own knowledge and judgment, leaders identify civil considerations that affect their mission. Commanders typically analyze civil considerations using six factors known collectively as ASCOPE: areas,   \n",

Contingency plans are often phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable to the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termination criteria. They address military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n- 2-33. Planning for a contingency encompasses the activities associated with the development of plans for the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces and resources in response to potential crises  identified  in  joint  strategic  planning documents.  The  level  of  planning  detail of contingency plans varies based on guidance and changes in the security environment. Planning details range from level 1 to level 4 as discussed in paragraphs 2-34 through 2-37. Although listed sequentially, during a crisis they may be conducted concurrently or compressed depending on the situation and conditions. (See JP 5-0 for more information on contingency planning and associated levels of planning detail.)\\n\\n## Level 1-Commander's Estimate\\n\\n- 2-34. The commander's estimate is the commander's initial assessment in which options are provided in a concise  statement  that  defines  who,  what,  when,  where,  why,  and  how  the  course  of  action  will  be implemented (JP 5-0). The commander's estimate, at planning level 1, involves the least amount of detail and focuses on producing multiple courses of action (COAs) to address a contingency. The product for this level can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander's estimate, or a memorandum with a required force  list.  The  commander's  estimate  provides  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  military  COAs  to  meet  a potential contingency.\\n\\n## Level 2-Base Plan\\n\\n- 2-35. A base plan, at planning level 2, describes the concept of operations, major forces, schemes of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes. A base plan may contain alternatives, including flexible deterrent operations, to provide flexibility in addressing a contingency as it develops or to aid in developing the situation.\\n\\n## Level 3-Concept Plan\\n\\n- 2-36.

METT-TC (I) represents the mission variables leaders use to analyze and understand a situation in relationship to the unit's mission. Informational considerations are those aspects of the human, information and physical dimensions that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, use, act upon, and  are  impacted  by  information  (FM  3-0).  Informational  considerations  is  expressed  as  a  parenthetical variable in that it is not an independent variable, but an important component of each variable of METT-TC that leaders pay particular attention to when developing understanding of a situation. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the mission variables.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND, AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS\\n\\n- 1-26. Planning  helps  leaders  better  understand  and  identify  problems  and  develop  solutions  to  solve  or manage those problems. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or objective. In a broad sense, a problem exists when an individual becomes aware of a significant difference between what is currently observed or occurring in the environment, and what is desired. In the context of operations, an operational problem is the issue or set of issues that impede commanders from achieving their desired  end  state.  (See  paragraph  1-53  for  further  discussion  on  identification  of  problems  and  problem solving.) Identification of the actual problem to solve is critical to successful planning. Misidentification of the problem often leads to an ineffective plan and operational approach and time critical to subordinates for development of their plans.\\n- 1-27. Throughout operations, Army leaders face various problems, requiring unique and creative solutions. Not all problems require the same level of planning. Leaders often identify simple problems immediately and quickly decide on a solution-sometimes on the spot. However, planning is critical when a problem is a set of interrelated issues, and the solution to each issue affects the others. For unfamiliar situations, planning offers ways to solve the complete set of problems. In general, the more complex a situation is, the more important and involved the planning effort becomes.\\n\\n- 1-28. Just as planning is only part of the operations</td>\n",

Planners may also consider time and space when developing force ratios to more accurately assess where and when engagements could occur and how to determine appropriate force ratios.\\n\\n5-84. Planners first compare tangible factors of friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses, and vice versa, for  combat  maneuver  units  and  functional  and  multifunctional  units,  as  necessary.  From  this  objective analysis, planners produce force ratios which highlight advantages or vulnerabilities for each force that may be exploited or may need additional considerations or protection. These comparisons provide planners insight into effective force employment recommendations. (Refer to FM 3-0 for more information on the dynamics of combat power.)\\n\\n5-85. After computing force ratios, the staff analyzes the intangible aspects of combat power. A technique for this analysis is conducting a subjective comparison of friendly strengths and enemy weaknesses for each dynamic of combat power. The resulting analysis can be beneficial by either reinforcing or offsetting the advantages and vulnerabilities identified by the objective analysis. Often, the intangible factors are more\\n\\nimportant than the number of tanks or tubes of artillery. This can lead to planner's effectively identifying decision points for the effective employment of forces. (See table 5-4 for an example of a relative combat power assessment.)\\n\\nTable 5-4. Example relative combat power assessment\\n\\n5-86. In troop-to-task analysis for stability and defense support of civil authorities, staffs determine relative combat power by comparing available resources to specified or implied stability or defense support of civil authorities tasks. This analysis provides insights into available options and needed resources.\\n\\n## Generate Options\\n\\n5-87. Based on the commander's guidance and the results of the initial relative combat power assessment, the staff generates options. A good COA can defeat feasible enemy COAs and ensure the unit remains flexible to execute branches or sequels. In an unconstrained planning environment, planners aim to develop several possible COAs. Depending on available time, commanders may limit the planning options, consistent with the commander's guidance. Options focus on enemy COAs arranged in order of their probable adoption.\\n\\n5-88. Brainstorming can be used for generating options. It requires extra time, imagination, and creativity, but it produces the widest range of options.

In planning priorities, commanders plan a be-prepared mission after any on-order mission.\\n- 5-38. Once staff members have identified specified and implied tasks, they ensure understanding of each task's requirements and purpose. The staff then identifies one or two essential tasks. An essential task is a specified or implied task that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential tasks are always included in the unit's mission statement.\\n\\n## Review Available Assets and Identify Resource Shortfalls\\n\\n5-39. The commander and staff analyze the current task organization, command and support relationships, and status (including current capabilities and limitations) of all units, specifically identifying changes. This analysis also includes capabilities of civilian and military organizations (including joint and multinational) that  operate  within  their  unit's  assigned  area  or  are  otherwise  designated  to  support.  They  consider relationships  among  specified,  implied,  and  essential  tasks  and  available  assets.  Staff  officers  use  the capabilities and resources recorded in their running estimates as a starting point for their analysis. From this analysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all tasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commanders a rough comparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may request from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success. Staffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commanders to understand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets and relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\n\\n## Determine Constraints\\n\\n5-40. The  commander  and  staff  identify  any  constraints  placed  on  their  command.  A constraint is  a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the OPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example, may contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs, or in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a starting point to their analysis.</td>\n",

Additionally,  it  provides  a  structure  and  framework  for  the  staff  to  work  collectively  and  produce  a coordinated plan. Externally, the MDMP facilitates information sharing among headquarters. As decisions, information, and staff products become available, the higher headquarters sends them to subordinates in WARNORDs.  WARNORDs  facilitate  parallel  planning  by  providing  critical  information  to  allow subordinates to start necessary planning and preparation activities.\\n\\n## Role of the Commander\\n\\n- 5-7. Commanders are the most important participants in the MDMP. Through their presence and actions, commanders  actively  drive  this  portion  of  the  operations  process.  More  than  simply  decision  makers, commanders use  their  experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  to  guide  staff  planning  efforts.  During  the MDMP, commanders focus their activities on understanding and visualizing the OE and describing their commander's visualization. While unable to devote all their time to the MDMP, commanders follow the status of the planning effort, participate during critical points of the process, provide guidance, and make decisions based on the detailed work of their staff. The commander issues guidance throughout the MDMP including, but not limited, to the following:\\n- · Upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission (initial planning guidance).\\n- · Following mission analysis (planning guidance for COA development, the desired end state and commander's intent).\\n- · Following COA development (revised planning guidance for COA analysis).\\n- · During COA approval (revised planning guidance to complete the plan).\\n- · Upon receipt of new information that invalidates assumptions or changes understanding of the OE.\\n\\n5-8. Commanders use their experience and judgment to add depth and clarity to their planning guidance. They ensure staffs understand the broad outline of their visualization while allowing the latitude necessary to explore different options. This guidance provides the basis for a detailed concept of operations without dictating the specifics of the final plan. As with their intent, the commander may modify planning guidance based on staff and subordinate input and changing conditions.\\n\\n5-9.

The chapter begins by discussing problem solving as related to decision making. This chapter establishes the base logic for all other problem-solving planning processes. The chapter concludes by discussing the seven-step process used in Army problem solving.\\n\\n## PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING\\n\\n- 3-1. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for leaders. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal, objective, or end state. Army problem solving is a form of decision making. It is a systematic approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the best solution, and implementing it. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to also do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success.\\n- 3-2. Not all problems require lengthy analysis to solve. For simple problems, leaders often make decisions quickly-sometimes  on  the  spot.  However,  for  complicated  problems  involving  a  variety  of  factors,  a systematic  problem-solving  approach  is  essential.  How  much  analysis  is  required  to  effectively  solve  a problem depends on the problem's complexity, the leader's experience, and amount of time available.\\n- 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally. (See FM 6-0 for more information on staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings.)\\n- 3-4. Problem solving is an art and science. It is a structured analytic process designed to ensure that all critical factors relevant to the problem are considered, and the relationships between variables are anticipated and accounted for in the solution. This ensures that the desired objective or end state is achieved in the most effective and efficient manner.\\n- 3-5. The art of problem solving involves subjective analysis of variables that, in many cases, cannot be easily measured. Leadership and morale, for example, are difficult to measure, but they</td>\n",

Contingency\\n\\nplans are branches of combatant command campaign plans. The CPG focuses the guidance given in the NSS and NDS and is the principal source document for the JSCP.

The JSCP provides this guidance to CCDRs, Service chiefs,  combat support agencies and applicable DOD agencies for preparation of plans based on current military capabilities, strategic guidance and contingency planning guidance identified to the CJCS in the CPG.\\n- 2-17. In addition to communicating to the CCMDs' specific planning guidance, the JSCP operationalizes the strategic vision described in the NMS and nests with the strategic direction delineated by the NSS, NDS, and GFMIG. The JSCP also provides integrated planning guidance and direction for planners to fulfill the CJCS's role as the global integrator.\\n\\n## Global Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-18. A global campaign plan is the primary means by which the CJCS or designated CCDRs arrange for unity of effort through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs) and functional responsibilities. Global campaign plans address the most  pressing  transregional  and  multifunctional  strategic  challenges  across  all  domains.

The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders. In the absence of the commander, key planning staff members must continually review progress and resolve questions and concerns with the commander at opportune times.\\n\\n- 1-137. The second pitfall is a lack of timely decisions by the commander necessary to continue effective planning. Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force.\\n- 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present. These plans often underestimate the scope of changes in directions that may occur and the results of second- and third-order effects. Even the most effective plans cannot anticipate all the unexpected events. Often, events overcome plans much sooner than anticipated. The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events.\\n- 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall  often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include. However, planners often respond to uncertainty by planning in more detail to try to account for every possibility. Often this overplanning results in an extremely detailed plan  that  does  not  survive  the  friction  of  the</td>\n",

Capabilities can refer to the ability of  local  authorities-those  of  the  host  nation,  aggressor  nation,  or  some  other  body-to  provide  the population with key functions or services, such as public administration, public safety, emergency services, and  food.  Primary  capabilities  include  those  areas  that  the  population  may  need  help  with  after  combat operations, such as public works and utilities, public health, economics, and commerce. Capabilities also refer to resources and services that can be contracted to support the military mission, such as interpreters, laundry services, construction materials, and equipment. The host nation or other nations might provide these resources and services.\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nA-32. Organizations are nonmilitary groups or institutions in an assigned area. They influence and interact with the population, the force, and each other. They generally have a hierarchical structure, defined goals, established operations, fixed facilities or meeting places, and a means of financial or logistic support. Some organizations may be indigenous to the area. These may include church groups, social organizations, patriotic or  service  organizations,  labor  unions,  criminal  organizations,  and  community  watch  groups.  Other organizations  may  come  from  outside  an  assigned  area.  Examples  of  these  include  multinational corporations, United Nations agencies, U.S. governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the International Red Cross.\\n\\nA-33. Operations  also  often  require  commanders  to  coordinate  with  international  organizations  and nongovernmental organizations. Commanders remain familiar with organizations operating in their assigned area. Relevant  information  includes  information  about  their  activities,  capabilities,  and  limitations. Situational understanding includes understanding how the activities of different organizations may affect\\n\\nmilitary  operations  and  how  military  operations  may  affect  these  organizations'  activities.  From  this, commanders can determine how organizations and military forces can work together toward common goals when necessary.\\n\\nA-34.

Designating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and priorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times during an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success at the time.\\n- 1-40. Commanders  resource  supporting  efforts  with  the  minimum  assets  necessary  to  accomplish  the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort in an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n- 1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the current tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when positioning  their  reserve.  While  commanders  can  assign  their  reserve  a  wide  variety  of  tasks,  through planning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n- 1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution as the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). Priorities of movement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support that commanders may use to weight the main effort.\\n\\n## ANTICIPATE EVENTS\\n\\n- 1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and coordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated uncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables the force to adapt to changing circumstances. Planning provides an informed forecast of how future events may unfold and anticipates transitions. It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in advance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and thirdorder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and threats.\\n\\n1-44</td>\n",

It includes providing forces and assets to subordinate commanders and establishing their command and support relationships. When task organizing their force, commanders visualize capabilities of units two echelons below them, based on their visualization of tasks to subordinates one echelon below them. Some assets are retained under the commander's immediate control to retain flexibility to exploit opportunities or counter threats.\\n- 1-36. Task organizing includes establishing command  or  support  relationships among  subordinate commanders. Army command relationships define command responsibility and authority.  Army  support relationships define the purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another. Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to task-organizing for any operation. (See FM 3-0 for a detailed discussion of joint, multinational, and Army command and support relationships.)\\n- 1-37. Task-organizing results in a task organization -a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a  particular  mission  (ADP  5-0).  The  unit's  task  organization  is  stipulated  in  the  base  plan  or  order  or addressed  in  Annex  A  (Task  Organization)  to  the  base  plan  or  order.  The  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or operation  order  (OPORD)  also  stipulates  changes  in  the  task  organization  by  phase.  During  execution, commanders modify the task organization as required based on the situation through fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs). (See Appendix E for task organization format and instructions.)\\n- 1-38.  Commanders prioritize efforts by designating a main effort, supporting efforts, and a reserve. The main effort is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a given point in time is most critical to overall mission success (ADP 3-0). A supporting effort is  a  designated subordinate unit with a mission that supports the success of the main effort (ADP 3-0). A reserve is  that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from action at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3-90).\\n- 1-39.

(For  more  information  on  joint planning see JP-5-0.)\\n\\n## NATO PLANNING EFFORTS\\n\\n1-148. For NATO's operations, the United States and other NATO countries have developed and ratified an Allied joint doctrine hierarchy of publications outlining the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures that should be used during NATO operations. JFCs, their staffs, and subordinate forces should review and train with these publications prior to participating in NATO operations. For more information on NATO planning doctrine see AJP-5, Allied  Joint  Doctrine  for  the  Planning  of  Operations ,  or  APP-28, Tactical Planning for Land Forces .\\n\\n## MULTINATIONAL PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\n1-149. Multinational operations present unique challenges and demands throughout the planning process. Commanders  and  staffs  should  account  for  these  considerations  when  participating  in  multinational operations. The following are some of the considerations when planning multinational operations-\\n\\n- · Cultural and language issues.\\n- · Interoperability challenges.\\n- · National caveats on the use of respective forces.\\n- · The sharing of information and intelligence.\\n- · Rules of engagement.\\n- · Domestic and international laws.\\n- · Operational limitations on the use of contributed forces.\\n- · Weapons capabilities of participating nations.\\n- · Tactics of participating nations.\\n\\n(For more information on multinational operations planning, see FM 3-16.)\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n## Chapter 2\\n\\n## Planning and Operational Art\\n\\nThis chapter begins with a description of planning and the levels of warfare.

       "      <td>require the command to reframe. As such, commanders and planning teams develop reframing indicators. A reframing indicator helps identify a condition in an OE that has changed or that could cause a shift in the problem such that a current operational  approach  may  no  longer  be  valid.  Although  many  reframing  indicators  will  not  meet  the requirement for the commander's critical information requirement (CCIRs), some reframing indicators could be included in the CCIRs if they represent something that would cause the commander to consider near-term reframing and potential redesign. An example of such information could be the impending alliance of a regional nation with the enemy that shifts the balance of power, even though an earlier assumption was that this alliance would not occur. Reframing indicators support the commander's ability to understand, learn, adapt, and reframe as necessary. Examples of such information include-\\n\\n- · Changes in the original problem statement.\\n- · Significant changes in threat composition.\\n- · Significant changes in the threat's approach.\\n- · Significant changes in friendly capability.\\n- · Higher echelon headquarters' policy changes or directives that change the desired end state.\\n- · Unexpected lack of friendly progress toward objectives.\\n- · Shifts in international support or domestic will.\\n- · Key assumptions prove to be invalid.\\n\\n## ASSESSMENT PLAN\\n\\n4-99. The assessment plan incorporates reframing criteria in the form of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) that are used to evaluate completed tasks, achieved objectives, and obtained end-state conditions. An effective assessment plan incorporates the logic used to build the plan. The logic as to why the commander believes the actions in the plan will produce the desired results is an important consideration when developing the assessment plan. Recording and understanding this logic during ADM helps the staff recommend the appropriate indicators for assessing the operation. It also helps the commander and staff determine if they need to reframe the problem if assumptions prove false or the logic behind the plan appears flawed as operations progress. (See Chapter 8 for details on building an assessment plan.)\\n\\n## Chapter 5\\n\\n## The Military Decision-Making Process\\n\\nThis chapter defines and describes the military decision-making process (MDMP). It provides an overview of the process followed by a detailed explanation for conducting each step of the MDMP.

The initial assessment also helps determine when to begin certain actions to ensure forces are ready and in position before execution. This may require the commander to direct subordinates to start necessary movements, conduct task organization changes, begin information collection, and execute other preparation activities before completing the plan.\\n\\n- 5-21. Commanders and staffs allocate available planning time to prioritize different steps of the MDMP based on the given situation. For example, when conducting initial planning for a new operation, more time may be allocated to mission analysis than the other steps to develop a better understanding of the problem and OE. Time allocations will vary based on a variety of factors such as experience of the planning staff, products already available, and commander involvement. Table 5-1 depicts an example planning time allocation.\\n\\nTable 5-1. Planning time allocation\\n\\nNote. The initial time allocation is made during Step 1 to guide initial planning efforts. The commander and staff continue to adjust it as they gain a better understanding of time available during the following steps of the MDMP.\\n\\n5-22. Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. Time, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The commander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum time for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of two-thirds  of  available  time  for  subordinate  units  to  conduct  their  planning  and  preparation.  This  leaves one-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the other  two-thirds  for  their  own  preparation.

In addition to planning, problem solving includes implementing the planned solution (execution), learning from the implementation of the solution (assessment), and modifying or developing a new solution as required. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success. (See Chapter 3 on Army problem solving.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, MITIGATE, AND ACCEPT RISK\\n\\n- 1-29. Risk-the  exposure  of  someone  or  something  valued  to  danger,  harm,  or  loss-is  inherent  in  all operations. Because risk is part of all military operations, it cannot be avoided. Risk may range for resource shortfall or a course of actions that exposed a friendly force's flank. Identifying, mitigating, and accepting risk is a function of command and a key consideration during planning.\\n- 1-30. During  planning,  commanders  and  staffs  analyze  risk  in  collaboration  with  subordinates  and  their higher-level headquarters to help determine what level of risk exists and how to mitigate it. When considering how much risk to accept with a course of action, commanders consider risk to the force and risk to the mission against the perceived benefit. They apply judgment with regards to the importance of an objective, time available, and anticipated cost. Commanders balance the tension between protecting the force and accepting and managing risks that must be taken to accomplish their mission. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk as an element of operational art.)\\n\\n## DIRECT, COORDINATE, AND SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS\\n\\n- 1-31. Plans  and  orders  are  the  principal  means  commanders  use  to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize actions. They also inform those outside the unit how to cooperate and provide support. Effective plans and orders direct subordinates by stating what is required (the task) and why (the purpose). They leave much of the how (the method) up to subordinates.\\n- 1-32. Plans and orders contain control measures to coordinate and synchronize action. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions (ADP 6-0).

This is vital to develop an effective operational approach to solve or manage identified problems. Here is an example of an initial problem statement based on the Freeland scenario.\\n\\nProblem statement: Aggressland forces are escalating their offensive activities against Freeland to destabilize the democratic government in Freeland and expand their regional hegemony. For more than fifty years, Freeland has maintained diplomatic, information, military, and economic autonomy. Other regional nations and world democracies have provided limited diplomatic and military support to Freeland, but these efforts have been insufficient to deter border incursions from Aggressland. Freeland is a diplomatic and economic partner to the U.S., but military partnership has been limited due to potentially negative international policy impacts. Freeland's military and civil defense forces are limited in size but are relatively modern. Aggressland has maintained a long-standing strategic rivalry with the U.S. To maintain deterrence and regional access, prevent crisis in Freeland, and bolster regional stability, the U.S. must be prepared for armed conflict in support of the defense of Freeland.\\n\\n- 4-63. Commanders and planners continue to develop the problem narrative as they learn more about an OE and develop an operational approach. For example, the small size of the Freeland defense force is a significant issue,  but  not  the  only  one.  After  discussing  the  problem  narrative  with  the  commander  and  others,  the planning team may expand the narrative by including problems associated with-\\n- · Availability of potential ports or intermediate staging locations for military forces.\\n- · Potential for special purpose attacks against regional partners, forward deployed military forces, or sustainment nodes.\\n- · Reinforcement of Freeland armed forces.\\n- · Influence of the adversary on other regional neighbors of Freeland.\\n- · Established adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities surrounding Freeland.\\n\\n## DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH\\n\\n4-64.

They do this by developing an operational approach-a description of the broad actions the force must take  to  transform  current  conditions  into  those  desired  at  end  state.

Leaders understand the status of their Soldiers' morale, their experience and training, and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. They determine all available resources and assess their capabilities. This  includes  troops  attached  to,  or  in  direct  support  of,  the  unit.  The  assessment  includes  knowing  the strength and status of unit equipment. It also includes understanding the full array of assets in support of the unit.  Leaders  know,  for  example,  how  much  indirect  fire,  space,  cyberspace,  or  information  operation capabilities will become available, when they are available, and they will know the best assets to inform planning. Leaders should consider any new limitations based on the level of training or recent operations.\\n\\n## TIME AVAILABLE\\n\\nA-26. Leaders not only appreciate how much time is available, but they also understand the time and space aspects  of  preparing,  moving,  fighting,  and  sustaining.  They  view  their  own  tasks  and  enemy  actions  in relation to time. They know how long it takes under different conditions to prepare for certain tasks (such as orders production, rehearsals, and subordinate element preparations). Leaders should remain mindful of the extended  timelines  generally  associated  with  achieving  information  effects  such  as  achieving  cognitive effects on enemy forces or creating and executing desired offensive cyberspace effects. Most importantly, leaders monitor the time available. As events occur, they assess their impact on the unit timeline and update previous timelines for their subordinates. Timelines list all events that affect the unit and its subordinate elements.\\n\\n## CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nA-27. Military  operations  are  rarely  conducted  in  uninhabited  areas.  Units  are  often  surrounded  by noncombatants. These noncombatants may include residents within the assigned area, local officials, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Leaders strive to understand the behaviors and attitudes of populations, to include discerning if they are hostile, friendly, or neutral to friendly forces and how they may be influenced.

Contingency plans are often phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable to the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termination criteria. They address military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n- 2-33. Planning for a contingency encompasses the activities associated with the development of plans for the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces and resources in response to potential crises  identified  in  joint  strategic  planning documents.  The  level  of  planning  detail of contingency plans varies based on guidance and changes in the security environment. Planning details range from level 1 to level 4 as discussed in paragraphs 2-34 through 2-37. Although listed sequentially, during a crisis they may be conducted concurrently or compressed depending on the situation and conditions. (See JP 5-0 for more information on contingency planning and associated levels of planning detail.)\\n\\n## Level 1-Commander's Estimate\\n\\n- 2-34. The commander's estimate is the commander's initial assessment in which options are provided in a concise  statement  that  defines  who,  what,  when,  where,  why,  and  how  the  course  of  action  will  be implemented (JP 5-0). The commander's estimate, at planning level 1, involves the least amount of detail and focuses on producing multiple courses of action (COAs) to address a contingency. The product for this level can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander's estimate, or a memorandum with a required force  list.  The  commander's  estimate  provides  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  military  COAs  to  meet  a potential contingency.\\n\\n## Level 2-Base Plan\\n\\n- 2-35. A base plan, at planning level 2, describes the concept of operations, major forces, schemes of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes.

METT-TC (I) represents the mission variables leaders use to analyze and understand a situation in relationship to the unit's mission. Informational considerations are those aspects of the human, information and physical dimensions that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, use, act upon, and  are  impacted  by  information  (FM  3-0).  Informational  considerations  is  expressed  as  a  parenthetical variable in that it is not an independent variable, but an important component of each variable of METT-TC that leaders pay particular attention to when developing understanding of a situation. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the mission variables.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND, AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS\\n\\n- 1-26. Planning  helps  leaders  better  understand  and  identify  problems  and  develop  solutions  to  solve  or manage those problems. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or objective. In a broad sense, a problem exists when an individual becomes aware of a significant difference between what is currently observed or occurring in the environment, and what is desired. In the context of operations, an operational problem is the issue or set of issues that impede commanders from achieving their desired  end  state.  (See  paragraph  1-53  for  further  discussion  on  identification  of  problems  and  problem solving.) Identification of the actual problem to solve is critical to successful planning. Misidentification of the problem often leads to an ineffective plan and operational approach and time critical to subordinates for development of their plans.\\n- 1-27. Throughout operations, Army leaders face various problems, requiring unique and creative solutions. Not all problems require the same level of planning. Leaders often identify simple problems immediately and quickly decide on a solution-sometimes on the spot. However, planning is critical when a problem is a set of interrelated issues, and the solution to each issue affects the others. For unfamiliar situations, planning offers ways to solve the complete set of problems. In general, the more complex a situation is, the more important and involved the planning effort becomes.\\n\\n- 1-28. Just as planning is only part of the operations</td>\n",

       "      <td>the assessment is also largely subjective. Planners may also consider time and space when developing force ratios to more accurately assess where and when engagements could occur and how to determine appropriate force ratios.\\n\\n5-84. Planners first compare tangible factors of friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses, and vice versa, for  combat  maneuver  units  and  functional  and  multifunctional  units,  as  necessary.  From  this  objective analysis, planners produce force ratios which highlight advantages or vulnerabilities for each force that may be exploited or may need additional considerations or protection. These comparisons provide planners insight into effective force employment recommendations. (Refer to FM 3-0 for more information on the dynamics of combat power.)\\n\\n5-85. After computing force ratios, the staff analyzes the intangible aspects of combat power. A technique for this analysis is conducting a subjective comparison of friendly strengths and enemy weaknesses for each dynamic of combat power. The resulting analysis can be beneficial by either reinforcing or offsetting the advantages and vulnerabilities identified by the objective analysis. Often, the intangible factors are more\\n\\nimportant than the number of tanks or tubes of artillery. This can lead to planner's effectively identifying decision points for the effective employment of forces. (See table 5-4 for an example of a relative combat power assessment.)\\n\\nTable 5-4. Example relative combat power assessment\\n\\n5-86. In troop-to-task analysis for stability and defense support of civil authorities, staffs determine relative combat power by comparing available resources to specified or implied stability or defense support of civil authorities tasks. This analysis provides insights into available options and needed resources.\\n\\n## Generate Options\\n\\n5-87. Based on the commander's guidance and the results of the initial relative combat power assessment, the staff generates options. A good COA can defeat feasible enemy COAs and ensure the unit remains flexible to execute branches or sequels. In an unconstrained planning environment, planners aim to develop several possible COAs. Depending on available time, commanders may limit the planning options, consistent with the commander's guidance. Options focus on enemy COAs arranged in order of their probable adoption.\\n\\n5-88. Brainstorming can be used for generating options. It requires extra time, imagination, and creativity, but it produces the widest range of options. The staff (and members of organizations outside the headquarters) remains unbiased and open-minded when developing proposed options.\\n\\n- 5-89. In  developing</td>\n",

In planning priorities, commanders plan a be-prepared mission after any on-order mission.\\n- 5-38. Once staff members have identified specified and implied tasks, they ensure understanding of each task's requirements and purpose. The staff then identifies one or two essential tasks. An essential task is a specified or implied task that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential tasks are always included in the unit's mission statement.\\n\\n## Review Available Assets and Identify Resource Shortfalls\\n\\n5-39. The commander and staff analyze the current task organization, command and support relationships, and status (including current capabilities and limitations) of all units, specifically identifying changes. This analysis also includes capabilities of civilian and military organizations (including joint and multinational) that  operate  within  their  unit's  assigned  area  or  are  otherwise  designated  to  support.  They  consider relationships  among  specified,  implied,  and  essential  tasks  and  available  assets.  Staff  officers  use  the capabilities and resources recorded in their running estimates as a starting point for their analysis. From this analysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all tasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commanders a rough comparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may request from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success. Staffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commanders to understand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets and relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\n\\n## Determine Constraints\\n\\n5-40. The  commander  and  staff  identify  any  constraints  placed  on  their  command.  A constraint is  a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the OPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example, may contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs, or in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a starting point to their analysis.</td>\n",

Additionally,  it  provides  a  structure  and  framework  for  the  staff  to  work  collectively  and  produce  a coordinated plan. Externally, the MDMP facilitates information sharing among headquarters. As decisions, information, and staff products become available, the higher headquarters sends them to subordinates in WARNORDs.  WARNORDs  facilitate  parallel  planning  by  providing  critical  information  to  allow subordinates to start necessary planning and preparation activities.\\n\\n## Role of the Commander\\n\\n- 5-7. Commanders are the most important participants in the MDMP. Through their presence and actions, commanders  actively  drive  this  portion  of  the  operations  process.  More  than  simply  decision  makers, commanders use  their  experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  to  guide  staff  planning  efforts.  During  the MDMP, commanders focus their activities on understanding and visualizing the OE and describing their commander's visualization. While unable to devote all their time to the MDMP, commanders follow the status of the planning effort, participate during critical points of the process, provide guidance, and make decisions based on the detailed work of their staff. The commander issues guidance throughout the MDMP including, but not limited, to the following:\\n- · Upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission (initial planning guidance).\\n- · Following mission analysis (planning guidance for COA development, the desired end state and commander's intent).\\n- · Following COA development (revised planning guidance for COA analysis).\\n- · During COA approval (revised planning guidance to complete the plan).\\n- · Upon receipt of new information that invalidates assumptions or changes understanding of the OE.\\n\\n5-8. Commanders use their experience and judgment to add depth and clarity to their planning guidance. They ensure staffs understand the broad outline of their visualization while allowing the latitude necessary to explore different options. This guidance provides the basis for a detailed concept of operations without dictating the specifics of the final plan. As with their intent, the commander may modify planning guidance based on staff and subordinate input and changing conditions.\\n\\n5-9.

The chapter begins by discussing problem solving as related to decision making. This chapter establishes the base logic for all other problem-solving planning processes. The chapter concludes by discussing the seven-step process used in Army problem solving.\\n\\n## PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION MAKING\\n\\n- 3-1. The ability to recognize and effectively solve problems is an essential skill for leaders. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal, objective, or end state. Army problem solving is a form of decision making. It is a systematic approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the best solution, and implementing it. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to also do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success.\\n- 3-2. Not all problems require lengthy analysis to solve. For simple problems, leaders often make decisions quickly-sometimes  on  the  spot.  However,  for  complicated  problems  involving  a  variety  of  factors,  a systematic  problem-solving  approach  is  essential.  How  much  analysis  is  required  to  effectively  solve  a problem depends on the problem's complexity, the leader's experience, and amount of time available.\\n- 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally. (See FM 6-0 for more information on staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings.)\\n- 3-4. Problem solving is an art and science. It is a structured analytic process designed to ensure that all critical factors relevant to the problem are considered, and the relationships between variables are anticipated and accounted for in the solution. This ensures that the desired objective or end state is achieved in the most effective and efficient manner.\\n- 3-5. The art of problem solving involves subjective analysis of variables that, in many cases, cannot be easily measured. Leadership and morale, for example, are difficult to measure, but they</td>\n",

Prepared by DOD and approved by the President, the CPG fulfills the statutory requirement in Title 10, USC, Section 113 and provides written policy guidance on the preparation and review of campaign and contingency plans (including prioritization) to the CJCS and CCDRs for contingency planning. Contingency\\n\\nplans are branches of combatant command campaign plans. The CPG focuses the guidance given in the NSS and NDS and is the principal source document for the JSCP.

The JSCP fulfills  the  CJCS's  statutory  responsibilities  in Title  10,  USC,  Section  153,  to  assist  the President and Secretary of Defense in providing for strategic direction to the joint force and implementing the strategic guidance in the NSS, NDS, NMS, and CPG. The JSCP provides this guidance to CCDRs, Service chiefs,  combat support agencies and applicable DOD agencies for preparation of plans based on current military capabilities, strategic guidance and contingency planning guidance identified to the CJCS in the CPG.\\n- 2-17. In addition to communicating to the CCMDs' specific planning guidance, the JSCP operationalizes the strategic vision described in the NMS and nests with the strategic direction delineated by the NSS, NDS, and GFMIG. The JSCP also provides integrated planning guidance and direction for planners to fulfill the CJCS's role as the global integrator.\\n\\n## Global Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-18. A global campaign plan is the primary means by which the CJCS or designated CCDRs arrange for unity of effort through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs) and functional responsibilities. Global campaign plans address the most  pressing  transregional  and  multifunctional  strategic  challenges  across  all  domains.

The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders. In the absence of the commander, key planning staff members must continually review progress and resolve questions and concerns with the commander at opportune times.\\n\\n- 1-137. The second pitfall is a lack of timely decisions by the commander necessary to continue effective planning. Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force.\\n- 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present. These plans often underestimate the scope of changes in directions that may occur and the results of second- and third-order effects. Even the most effective plans cannot anticipate all the unexpected events. Often, events overcome plans much sooner than anticipated. The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events.\\n- 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall  often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include. However, planners often respond to uncertainty by planning in more detail to try to account for every possibility. Often this overplanning results in an extremely detailed plan  that  does  not  survive  the  friction  of  the</td>\n",

Primary  capabilities  include  those  areas  that  the  population  may  need  help  with  after  combat operations, such as public works and utilities, public health, economics, and commerce. Capabilities also refer to resources and services that can be contracted to support the military mission, such as interpreters, laundry services, construction materials, and equipment. The host nation or other nations might provide these resources and services.\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nA-32. Organizations are nonmilitary groups or institutions in an assigned area. They influence and interact with the population, the force, and each other. They generally have a hierarchical structure, defined goals, established operations, fixed facilities or meeting places, and a means of financial or logistic support. Some organizations may be indigenous to the area. These may include church groups, social organizations, patriotic or  service  organizations,  labor  unions,  criminal  organizations,  and  community  watch  groups.  Other organizations  may  come  from  outside  an  assigned  area.  Examples  of  these  include  multinational corporations, United Nations agencies, U.S. governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the International Red Cross.\\n\\nA-33. Operations  also  often  require  commanders  to  coordinate  with  international  organizations  and nongovernmental organizations. Commanders remain familiar with organizations operating in their assigned area. Relevant  information  includes  information  about  their  activities,  capabilities,  and  limitations. Situational understanding includes understanding how the activities of different organizations may affect\\n\\nmilitary  operations  and  how  military  operations  may  affect  these  organizations'  activities.  From  this, commanders can determine how organizations and military forces can work together toward common goals when necessary.\\n\\nA-34.

Commanders may shift the main effort several times during an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success at the time.\\n- 1-40. Commanders  resource  supporting  efforts  with  the  minimum  assets  necessary  to  accomplish  the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort in an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n- 1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the current tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when positioning  their  reserve.  While  commanders  can  assign  their  reserve  a  wide  variety  of  tasks,  through planning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n- 1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution as the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). Priorities of movement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support that commanders may use to weight the main effort.\\n\\n## ANTICIPATE EVENTS\\n\\n- 1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and coordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated uncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables the force to adapt to changing circumstances. Planning provides an informed forecast of how future events may unfold and anticipates transitions. It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in advance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and thirdorder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and threats.\\n\\n1-44</td>\n",

It includes providing forces and assets to subordinate commanders and establishing their command and support relationships. When task organizing their force, commanders visualize capabilities of units two echelons below them, based on their visualization of tasks to subordinates one echelon below them. Some assets are retained under the commander's immediate control to retain flexibility to exploit opportunities or counter threats.\\n- 1-36. Task organizing includes establishing command  or  support  relationships among  subordinate commanders. Army command relationships define command responsibility and authority.  Army  support relationships define the purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another. Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to task-organizing for any operation. (See FM 3-0 for a detailed discussion of joint, multinational, and Army command and support relationships.)\\n- 1-37. Task-organizing results in a task organization -a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a  particular  mission  (ADP  5-0).  The  unit's  task  organization  is  stipulated  in  the  base  plan  or  order  or addressed  in  Annex  A  (Task  Organization)  to  the  base  plan  or  order.  The  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or operation  order  (OPORD)  also  stipulates  changes  in  the  task  organization  by  phase.  During  execution, commanders modify the task organization as required based on the situation through fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs). (See Appendix E for task organization format and instructions.)\\n- 1-38.  Commanders prioritize efforts by designating a main effort, supporting efforts, and a reserve. The main effort is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a given point in time is most critical to overall mission success (ADP 3-0).

For NATO's operations, the United States and other NATO countries have developed and ratified an Allied joint doctrine hierarchy of publications outlining the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures that should be used during NATO operations.

A reframing indicator helps identify a condition in an OE that has changed or that could cause a shift in the problem such that a current operational  approach  may  no  longer  be  valid.  Although  many  reframing  indicators  will  not  meet  the requirement for the commander's critical information requirement (CCIRs), some reframing indicators could be included in the CCIRs if they represent something that would cause the commander to consider near-term reframing and potential redesign. An example of such information could be the impending alliance of a regional nation with the enemy that shifts the balance of power, even though an earlier assumption was that this alliance would not occur. Reframing indicators support the commander's ability to understand, learn, adapt, and reframe as necessary. Examples of such information include-\\n\\n- · Changes in the original problem statement.\\n- · Significant changes in threat composition.\\n- · Significant changes in the threat's approach.\\n- · Significant changes in friendly capability.\\n- · Higher echelon headquarters' policy changes or directives that change the desired end state.\\n- · Unexpected lack of friendly progress toward objectives.\\n- · Shifts in international support or domestic will.\\n- · Key assumptions prove to be invalid.\\n\\n## ASSESSMENT PLAN\\n\\n4-99. The assessment plan incorporates reframing criteria in the form of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) that are used to evaluate completed tasks, achieved objectives, and obtained end-state conditions. An effective assessment plan incorporates the logic used to build the plan. The logic as to why the commander believes the actions in the plan will produce the desired results is an important consideration when developing the assessment plan. Recording and understanding this logic during ADM helps the staff recommend the appropriate indicators for assessing the operation. It also helps the commander and staff determine if they need to reframe the problem if assumptions prove false or the logic behind the plan appears flawed as operations progress. (See Chapter 8 for details on building an assessment plan.)\\n\\n## Chapter 5\\n\\n## The Military Decision-Making Process\\n\\nThis chapter defines and describes the military decision-making process (MDMP).

The initial assessment also helps determine when to begin certain actions to ensure forces are ready and in position before execution. This may require the commander to direct subordinates to start necessary movements, conduct task organization changes, begin information collection, and execute other preparation activities before completing the plan.\\n\\n- 5-21. Commanders and staffs allocate available planning time to prioritize different steps of the MDMP based on the given situation. For example, when conducting initial planning for a new operation, more time may be allocated to mission analysis than the other steps to develop a better understanding of the problem and OE. Time allocations will vary based on a variety of factors such as experience of the planning staff, products already available, and commander involvement. Table 5-1 depicts an example planning time allocation.\\n\\nTable 5-1. Planning time allocation\\n\\nNote. The initial time allocation is made during Step 1 to guide initial planning efforts. The commander and staff continue to adjust it as they gain a better understanding of time available during the following steps of the MDMP.\\n\\n5-22. Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. Time, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The commander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum time for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of two-thirds  of  available  time  for  subordinate  units  to  conduct  their  planning  and  preparation.  This  leaves one-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the other  two-thirds  for  their  own  preparation.

Risk-the  exposure  of  someone  or  something  valued  to  danger,  harm,  or  loss-is  inherent  in  all operations. Because risk is part of all military operations, it cannot be avoided. Risk may range for resource shortfall or a course of actions that exposed a friendly force's flank. Identifying, mitigating, and accepting risk is a function of command and a key consideration during planning.\\n- 1-30. During  planning,  commanders  and  staffs  analyze  risk  in  collaboration  with  subordinates  and  their higher-level headquarters to help determine what level of risk exists and how to mitigate it. When considering how much risk to accept with a course of action, commanders consider risk to the force and risk to the mission against the perceived benefit. They apply judgment with regards to the importance of an objective, time available, and anticipated cost. Commanders balance the tension between protecting the force and accepting and managing risks that must be taken to accomplish their mission. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk as an element of operational art.)\\n\\n## DIRECT, COORDINATE, AND SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS\\n\\n- 1-31. Plans  and  orders  are  the  principal  means  commanders  use  to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize actions. They also inform those outside the unit how to cooperate and provide support. Effective plans and orders direct subordinates by stating what is required (the task) and why (the purpose). They leave much of the how (the method) up to subordinates.\\n- 1-32.

For more than fifty years, Freeland has maintained diplomatic, information, military, and economic autonomy. Other regional nations and world democracies have provided limited diplomatic and military support to Freeland, but these efforts have been insufficient to deter border incursions from Aggressland. Freeland is a diplomatic and economic partner to the U.S., but military partnership has been limited due to potentially negative international policy impacts. Freeland's military and civil defense forces are limited in size but are relatively modern. Aggressland has maintained a long-standing strategic rivalry with the U.S. To maintain deterrence and regional access, prevent crisis in Freeland, and bolster regional stability, the U.S. must be prepared for armed conflict in support of the defense of Freeland.\\n\\n- 4-63. Commanders and planners continue to develop the problem narrative as they learn more about an OE and develop an operational approach. For example, the small size of the Freeland defense force is a significant issue,  but  not  the  only  one.  After  discussing  the  problem  narrative  with  the  commander  and  others,  the planning team may expand the narrative by including problems associated with-\\n- · Availability of potential ports or intermediate staging locations for military forces.\\n- · Potential for special purpose attacks against regional partners, forward deployed military forces, or sustainment nodes.\\n- · Reinforcement of Freeland armed forces.\\n- · Influence of the adversary on other regional neighbors of Freeland.\\n- · Established adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities surrounding Freeland.\\n\\n## DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH\\n\\n4-64.

       "      <td>the most important aspect of mission analysis is determining the combat power of one's own force. Leaders understand the status of their Soldiers' morale, their experience and training, and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. They determine all available resources and assess their capabilities. This  includes  troops  attached  to,  or  in  direct  support  of,  the  unit.  The  assessment  includes  knowing  the strength and status of unit equipment. It also includes understanding the full array of assets in support of the unit.  Leaders  know,  for  example,  how  much  indirect  fire,  space,  cyberspace,  or  information  operation capabilities will become available, when they are available, and they will know the best assets to inform planning. Leaders should consider any new limitations based on the level of training or recent operations.\\n\\n## TIME AVAILABLE\\n\\nA-26. Leaders not only appreciate how much time is available, but they also understand the time and space aspects  of  preparing,  moving,  fighting,  and  sustaining.  They  view  their  own  tasks  and  enemy  actions  in relation to time. They know how long it takes under different conditions to prepare for certain tasks (such as orders production, rehearsals, and subordinate element preparations). Leaders should remain mindful of the extended  timelines  generally  associated  with  achieving  information  effects  such  as  achieving  cognitive effects on enemy forces or creating and executing desired offensive cyberspace effects. Most importantly, leaders monitor the time available. As events occur, they assess their impact on the unit timeline and update previous timelines for their subordinates. Timelines list all events that affect the unit and its subordinate elements.\\n\\n## CIVIL CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nA-27. Military  operations  are  rarely  conducted  in  uninhabited  areas.  Units  are  often  surrounded  by noncombatants. These noncombatants may include residents within the assigned area, local officials, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Leaders strive to understand the behaviors and attitudes of populations, to include discerning if they are hostile, friendly, or neutral to friendly forces and how they may be influenced. Based on information from higher echelon headquarters and their own knowledge and judgment, leaders identify civil considerations that affect their mission.

Contingency plans are often phased, and they have specified end states. Contingency plans seek to re-establish conditions favorable to the United States. Contingency plans have an identified military objective and termination criteria. They address military operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to large-scale combat operations.\\n- 2-33. Planning for a contingency encompasses the activities associated with the development of plans for the deployment, employment, sustainment, and redeployment of forces and resources in response to potential crises  identified  in  joint  strategic  planning documents.  The  level  of  planning  detail of contingency plans varies based on guidance and changes in the security environment. Planning details range from level 1 to level 4 as discussed in paragraphs 2-34 through 2-37. Although listed sequentially, during a crisis they may be conducted concurrently or compressed depending on the situation and conditions. (See JP 5-0 for more information on contingency planning and associated levels of planning detail.)\\n\\n## Level 1-Commander's Estimate\\n\\n- 2-34. The commander's estimate is the commander's initial assessment in which options are provided in a concise  statement  that  defines  who,  what,  when,  where,  why,  and  how  the  course  of  action  will  be implemented (JP 5-0). The commander's estimate, at planning level 1, involves the least amount of detail and focuses on producing multiple courses of action (COAs) to address a contingency. The product for this level can be a COA briefing, command directive, commander's estimate, or a memorandum with a required force  list.  The  commander's  estimate  provides  the  Secretary  of  Defense  with  military  COAs  to  meet  a potential contingency.\\n\\n## Level 2-Base Plan\\n\\n- 2-35. A base plan, at planning level 2, describes the concept of operations, major forces, schemes of support, and anticipated timelines for completing the mission. It normally does not include annexes.

METT-TC (I) represents the mission variables leaders use to analyze and understand a situation in relationship to the unit's mission. Informational considerations are those aspects of the human, information and physical dimensions that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, use, act upon, and  are  impacted  by  information  (FM  3-0).  Informational  considerations  is  expressed  as  a  parenthetical variable in that it is not an independent variable, but an important component of each variable of METT-TC that leaders pay particular attention to when developing understanding of a situation. (See Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the mission variables.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND, AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS\\n\\n- 1-26. Planning  helps  leaders  better  understand  and  identify  problems  and  develop  solutions  to  solve  or manage those problems. A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal or objective. In a broad sense, a problem exists when an individual becomes aware of a significant difference between what is currently observed or occurring in the environment, and what is desired. In the context of operations, an operational problem is the issue or set of issues that impede commanders from achieving their desired  end  state.  (See  paragraph  1-53  for  further  discussion  on  identification  of  problems  and  problem solving.) Identification of the actual problem to solve is critical to successful planning. Misidentification of the problem often leads to an ineffective plan and operational approach and time critical to subordinates for development of their plans.\\n- 1-27. Throughout operations, Army leaders face various problems, requiring unique and creative solutions. Not all problems require the same level of planning. Leaders often identify simple problems immediately and quickly decide on a solution-sometimes on the spot. However, planning is critical when a problem is a set of interrelated issues, and the solution to each issue affects the others. For unfamiliar situations, planning offers ways to solve the complete set of problems. In general, the more complex a situation is, the more important and involved the planning effort becomes.\\n\\n- 1-28. Just as planning is only part of the operations</td>\n",

Planners may also consider time and space when developing force ratios to more accurately assess where and when engagements could occur and how to determine appropriate force ratios.\\n\\n5-84. Planners first compare tangible factors of friendly strengths against enemy weaknesses, and vice versa, for  combat  maneuver  units  and  functional  and  multifunctional  units,  as  necessary.  From  this  objective analysis, planners produce force ratios which highlight advantages or vulnerabilities for each force that may be exploited or may need additional considerations or protection. These comparisons provide planners insight into effective force employment recommendations. (Refer to FM 3-0 for more information on the dynamics of combat power.)\\n\\n5-85. After computing force ratios, the staff analyzes the intangible aspects of combat power. A technique for this analysis is conducting a subjective comparison of friendly strengths and enemy weaknesses for each dynamic of combat power. The resulting analysis can be beneficial by either reinforcing or offsetting the advantages and vulnerabilities identified by the objective analysis. Often, the intangible factors are more\\n\\nimportant than the number of tanks or tubes of artillery. This can lead to planner's effectively identifying decision points for the effective employment of forces. (See table 5-4 for an example of a relative combat power assessment.)\\n\\nTable 5-4. Example relative combat power assessment\\n\\n5-86. In troop-to-task analysis for stability and defense support of civil authorities, staffs determine relative combat power by comparing available resources to specified or implied stability or defense support of civil authorities tasks. This analysis provides insights into available options and needed resources.\\n\\n## Generate Options\\n\\n5-87. Based on the commander's guidance and the results of the initial relative combat power assessment, the staff generates options. A good COA can defeat feasible enemy COAs and ensure the unit remains flexible to execute branches or sequels. In an unconstrained planning environment, planners aim to develop several possible COAs. Depending on available time, commanders may limit the planning options, consistent with the commander's guidance. Options focus on enemy COAs arranged in order of their probable adoption.\\n\\n5-88. Brainstorming can be used for generating options. It requires extra time, imagination, and creativity, but it produces the widest range of options. The staff (and members of organizations outside the headquarters) remains unbiased and open-minded when developing proposed options.\\n\\n- 5-89. In  developing</td>\n",

In planning priorities, commanders plan a be-prepared mission after any on-order mission.\\n- 5-38. Once staff members have identified specified and implied tasks, they ensure understanding of each task's requirements and purpose. The staff then identifies one or two essential tasks. An essential task is a specified or implied task that must be executed to accomplish the mission. Essential tasks are always included in the unit's mission statement.\\n\\n## Review Available Assets and Identify Resource Shortfalls\\n\\n5-39. The commander and staff analyze the current task organization, command and support relationships, and status (including current capabilities and limitations) of all units, specifically identifying changes. This analysis also includes capabilities of civilian and military organizations (including joint and multinational) that  operate  within  their  unit's  assigned  area  or  are  otherwise  designated  to  support.  They  consider relationships  among  specified,  implied,  and  essential  tasks  and  available  assets.  Staff  officers  use  the capabilities and resources recorded in their running estimates as a starting point for their analysis. From this analysis, staffs conduct an initial assessment to determine if they have the resources needed to complete all tasks. Staffs may also conduct a preliminary relative combat power assessment to give commanders a rough comparison of friendly and enemy maneuver units. If obvious shortages are identified in any area, they may request from higher headquarters any additional resources or units believed necessary for mission success. Staffs also identify any deviations from the normal task organization and provide them to commanders to understand and consider when developing the planning guidance. A more detailed analysis of available assets and relative combat power occurs during COA development.\\n\\n## Determine Constraints\\n\\n5-40. The  commander  and  staff  identify  any  constraints  placed  on  their  command.  A constraint is  a restriction placed on the command by a higher command. A constraint dictates an action or inaction, thus restricting the freedom of action of a subordinate commander. Constraints are found in paragraph 3 of the OPLAN or OPORD. Annexes to the order may also include constraints. The operation overlay, for example, may contain a restrictive fire line or a no-fire area. Constraints may also be issued verbally, in WARNORDs, or in policy memoranda. Staff officers may use relevant constraints recorded in their running estimates as a starting point to their analysis.</td>\n",

Additionally,  it  provides  a  structure  and  framework  for  the  staff  to  work  collectively  and  produce  a coordinated plan. Externally, the MDMP facilitates information sharing among headquarters. As decisions, information, and staff products become available, the higher headquarters sends them to subordinates in WARNORDs.  WARNORDs  facilitate  parallel  planning  by  providing  critical  information  to  allow subordinates to start necessary planning and preparation activities.\\n\\n## Role of the Commander\\n\\n- 5-7. Commanders are the most important participants in the MDMP. Through their presence and actions, commanders  actively  drive  this  portion  of  the  operations  process.  More  than  simply  decision  makers, commanders use  their  experience,  knowledge,  and  judgment  to  guide  staff  planning  efforts.  During  the MDMP, commanders focus their activities on understanding and visualizing the OE and describing their commander's visualization. While unable to devote all their time to the MDMP, commanders follow the status of the planning effort, participate during critical points of the process, provide guidance, and make decisions based on the detailed work of their staff. The commander issues guidance throughout the MDMP including, but not limited, to the following:\\n- · Upon receipt of or in anticipation of a mission (initial planning guidance).\\n- · Following mission analysis (planning guidance for COA development, the desired end state and commander's intent).\\n- · Following COA development (revised planning guidance for COA analysis).\\n- · During COA approval (revised planning guidance to complete the plan).\\n- · Upon receipt of new information that invalidates assumptions or changes understanding of the OE.\\n\\n5-8. Commanders use their experience and judgment to add depth and clarity to their planning guidance. They ensure staffs understand the broad outline of their visualization while allowing the latitude necessary to explore different options. This guidance provides the basis for a detailed concept of operations without dictating the specifics of the final plan. As with their intent, the commander may modify planning guidance based on staff and subordinate input and changing conditions.\\n\\n5-9.

A problem is an issue or obstacle that makes it difficult to achieve a desired goal, objective, or end state. Army problem solving is a form of decision making. It is a systematic approach to defining a problem, developing possible solutions to solve the problem, arriving at the best solution, and implementing it. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to also do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success.\\n- 3-2. Not all problems require lengthy analysis to solve. For simple problems, leaders often make decisions quickly-sometimes  on  the  spot.  However,  for  complicated  problems  involving  a  variety  of  factors,  a systematic  problem-solving  approach  is  essential.  How  much  analysis  is  required  to  effectively  solve  a problem depends on the problem's complexity, the leader's experience, and amount of time available.\\n- 3-3. Army problem solving supports a single leader working alone or a group of leaders working together. Commanders normally direct their staffs or subordinate leaders to work together to recommend solutions to problems. In formal situations, they present their recommendations as staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings. At lower echelons, recommendations are normally presented orally. (See FM 6-0 for more information on staff studies, decision papers, and decision briefings.)\\n- 3-4. Problem solving is an art and science. It is a structured analytic process designed to ensure that all critical factors relevant to the problem are considered, and the relationships between variables are anticipated and accounted for in the solution. This ensures that the desired objective or end state is achieved in the most effective and efficient manner.\\n- 3-5. The art of problem solving involves subjective analysis of variables that, in many cases, cannot be easily measured. Leadership and morale, for example, are difficult to measure, but they</td>\n",

Prepared by DOD and approved by the President, the CPG fulfills the statutory requirement in Title 10, USC, Section 113 and provides written policy guidance on the preparation and review of campaign and contingency plans (including prioritization) to the CJCS and CCDRs for contingency planning. Contingency\\n\\nplans are branches of combatant command campaign plans. The CPG focuses the guidance given in the NSS and NDS and is the principal source document for the JSCP. (See paragraphs 2-31 through 2-33 for more information on contingency planning.)\\n\\n## Joint Strategic Campaign Plan\\n\\n- 2-16. The JSCP fulfills  the  CJCS's  statutory  responsibilities  in Title  10,  USC,  Section  153,  to  assist  the President and Secretary of Defense in providing for strategic direction to the joint force and implementing the strategic guidance in the NSS, NDS, NMS, and CPG. The JSCP provides this guidance to CCDRs, Service chiefs,  combat support agencies and applicable DOD agencies for preparation of plans based on current military capabilities, strategic guidance and contingency planning guidance identified to the CJCS in the CPG.\\n- 2-17. In addition to communicating to the CCMDs' specific planning guidance, the JSCP operationalizes the strategic vision described in the NMS and nests with the strategic direction delineated by the NSS, NDS, and GFMIG. The JSCP also provides integrated planning guidance and direction for planners to fulfill the CJCS's role as the global integrator.\\n\\n## Global Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-18. A global campaign plan is the primary means by which the CJCS or designated CCDRs arrange for unity of effort through which they guide the planning, integration, and coordination of joint operations across CCMD areas of responsibility (AORs) and functional responsibilities. Global campaign plans address the most  pressing  transregional  and  multifunctional  strategic  challenges  across  all  domains.  Each  global campaign plan has an assigned coordinating authority which is a CCDR with the primary responsibility for a global campaign plan. Contingency plans to a global campaign plan are called integrated contingency plans.\\n\\n## Functional Campaign Plans\\n\\n- 2-19.

       "      <td>\\n- · Institutionalizing rigid planning methods.\\n- · Lacking a sufficient level of planning detail.\\n\\n1-136. The first pitfall is the lack of commander involvement in the development of the plan. As discussed in paragraphs 1-84 through 1-96, the responsibility for planning is inherent in command. Commanders are the central figures in effective planning. Since the plan describes their visualization of the end state and how the force will achieve that end state, commanders must devote significant time and effort to the development of plans and orders. In the absence of the commander, key planning staff members must continually review progress and resolve questions and concerns with the commander at opportune times.\\n\\n- 1-137. The second pitfall is a lack of timely decisions by the commander necessary to continue effective planning. Pending or missing decisions can hinder the planning process and reduce developing a flexible and timely plan. In a rapidly changing and fluid environment, a lack of timely decisions can result in a loss of agility, initiative, or opportunities. The lack of timely decisions and timely plan development also inhibits subordinate planning and may unintentionally increase risk to the mission and force.\\n- 1-138. The third pitfall, attempting to forecast and dictate events too far into the future, may result from believing a plan can control the future. Planners tend to plan based on assumptions that the future will be a linear continuation of the present. These plans often underestimate the scope of changes in directions that may occur and the results of second- and third-order effects. Even the most effective plans cannot anticipate all the unexpected events. Often, events overcome plans much sooner than anticipated. The best analysis could simply be an understanding of what transition is most likely to occur, from which the most likely branches or sequels can be identified. Effective plans include sufficient branches and sequels to account for the nonlinear nature of events.\\n- 1-139. The fourth pitfall consists of trying to plan in too much detail. Sound plans include necessary details; however, planning in unnecessary detail consumes limited time and resources that subordinates need. This pitfall  often stems from the desire to leave as little as possible to chance. In general, the less certain the situation, the fewer details a plan should include. However, planners often respond to uncertainty by planning in more detail to try to account for every possibility. Often this overplanning results in an extremely detailed plan  that  does  not  survive  the  friction  of  the</td>\n",

Primary  capabilities  include  those  areas  that  the  population  may  need  help  with  after  combat operations, such as public works and utilities, public health, economics, and commerce. Capabilities also refer to resources and services that can be contracted to support the military mission, such as interpreters, laundry services, construction materials, and equipment. The host nation or other nations might provide these resources and services.\\n\\n## Organizations\\n\\nA-32. Organizations are nonmilitary groups or institutions in an assigned area. They influence and interact with the population, the force, and each other. They generally have a hierarchical structure, defined goals, established operations, fixed facilities or meeting places, and a means of financial or logistic support. Some organizations may be indigenous to the area. These may include church groups, social organizations, patriotic or  service  organizations,  labor  unions,  criminal  organizations,  and  community  watch  groups.  Other organizations  may  come  from  outside  an  assigned  area.  Examples  of  these  include  multinational corporations, United Nations agencies, U.S. governmental agencies, and nongovernmental organizations, such as the International Red Cross.\\n\\nA-33. Operations  also  often  require  commanders  to  coordinate  with  international  organizations  and nongovernmental organizations. Commanders remain familiar with organizations operating in their assigned area. Relevant  information  includes  information  about  their  activities,  capabilities,  and  limitations. Situational understanding includes understanding how the activities of different organizations may affect\\n\\nmilitary  operations  and  how  military  operations  may  affect  these  organizations'  activities.  From  this, commanders can determine how organizations and military forces can work together toward common goals when necessary.\\n\\nA-34.

Designating a main effort temporarily gives that unit priority for support. Commanders shift resources and priorities to the main effort as circumstances require. Commanders may shift the main effort several times during an operation based on which subordinate unit is most critical to overall mission success at the time.\\n- 1-40. Commanders  resource  supporting  efforts  with  the  minimum  assets  necessary  to  accomplish  the mission. Forces often realize success of the main effort through success of supporting efforts. A main effort in an earlier phase can be a supporting effort for a main effort in a later phase.\\n- 1-41. Commanders constitute a reserve and base the size of the reserve on the level of uncertainty in the current tactical situation. Commanders consider survivability, mobility, and the most likely mission when positioning  their  reserve.  While  commanders  can  assign  their  reserve  a  wide  variety  of  tasks,  through planning priorities, to perform on commitment, a reserve remains prepared to accomplish other missions.\\n- 1-42.  Commanders also establish priorities of support during planning and shift priorities during execution as the situation requires. A priority of support is a priority set by the commander to ensure a subordinate unit has support in accordance with its relative importance to accomplish the mission (ADP 5-0). Priorities of movement, fires, sustainment, and protection all illustrate priorities of support that commanders may use to weight the main effort.\\n\\n## ANTICIPATE EVENTS\\n\\n- 1-43. A fundamental tension exists between the desire to plan far into the future to facilitate preparation and coordination and the fact that the farther into the future the commander plans, the greater the associated uncertainty and potentially less relevant the plan will likely remain. Given the fundamentally uncertain nature of operations, the object of planning is not to eliminate uncertainty but to develop a flexible plan that enables the force to adapt to changing circumstances. Planning provides an informed forecast of how future events may unfold and anticipates transitions. It entails identifying and evaluating potential decisions and actions in advance, to include thinking through consequences of certain actions and the potential second- and thirdorder effects that may result. Planning involves thinking about ways to respond to potential opportunities and threats.\\n\\n1-44</td>\n",

It includes providing forces and assets to subordinate commanders and establishing their command and support relationships. When task organizing their force, commanders visualize capabilities of units two echelons below them, based on their visualization of tasks to subordinates one echelon below them. Some assets are retained under the commander's immediate control to retain flexibility to exploit opportunities or counter threats.\\n- 1-36. Task organizing includes establishing command  or  support  relationships among  subordinate commanders. Army command relationships define command responsibility and authority.  Army  support relationships define the purpose, scope, and effect desired when one capability supports another. Establishing clear command and support relationships is fundamental to task-organizing for any operation. (See FM 3-0 for a detailed discussion of joint, multinational, and Army command and support relationships.)\\n- 1-37. Task-organizing results in a task organization -a temporary grouping of forces designed to accomplish a  particular  mission  (ADP  5-0).  The  unit's  task  organization  is  stipulated  in  the  base  plan  or  order  or addressed  in  Annex  A  (Task  Organization)  to  the  base  plan  or  order.  The  operation  plan  (OPLAN)  or operation  order  (OPORD)  also  stipulates  changes  in  the  task  organization  by  phase.  During  execution, commanders modify the task organization as required based on the situation through fragmentary orders (FRAGORDs). (See Appendix E for task organization format and instructions.)\\n- 1-38.  Commanders prioritize efforts by designating a main effort, supporting efforts, and a reserve. The main effort is a designated subordinate unit whose mission at a given point in time is most critical to overall mission success (ADP 3-0). A supporting effort is  a  designated subordinate unit with a mission that supports the success of the main effort (ADP 3-0). A reserve is  that portion of a body of troops that is withheld from action at the beginning of an engagement to be available for a decisive movement (ADP 3-90).\\n- 1-39.

For NATO's operations, the United States and other NATO countries have developed and ratified an Allied joint doctrine hierarchy of publications outlining the doctrine and tactics, techniques, and procedures that should be used during NATO operations. JFCs, their staffs, and subordinate forces should review and train with these publications prior to participating in NATO operations.

Multinational operations present unique challenges and demands throughout the planning process. Commanders  and  staffs  should  account  for  these  considerations  when  participating  in  multinational operations. The following are some of the considerations when planning multinational operations-\\n\\n- · Cultural and language issues.\\n- · Interoperability challenges.\\n- · National caveats on the use of respective forces.\\n- · The sharing of information and intelligence.\\n- · Rules of engagement.\\n- · Domestic and international laws.\\n- · Operational limitations on the use of contributed forces.\\n- · Weapons capabilities of participating nations.\\n- · Tactics of participating nations.\\n\\n(For more information on multinational operations planning, see FM 3-16.)\\n\\nThis page intentionally left blank.\\n\\n## Chapter 2\\n\\n## Planning and Operational Art\\n\\nThis chapter begins with a description of planning and the levels of warfare. A discussion of operational art follows. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the elements of operational art and the tools available to commanders and staffs in the application of operational art.\\n\\n## PLANNING AND THE LEVELS OF WARFARE\\n\\n- 2-1.

A reframing indicator helps identify a condition in an OE that has changed or that could cause a shift in the problem such that a current operational  approach  may  no  longer  be  valid.  Although  many  reframing  indicators  will  not  meet  the requirement for the commander's critical information requirement (CCIRs), some reframing indicators could be included in the CCIRs if they represent something that would cause the commander to consider near-term reframing and potential redesign. An example of such information could be the impending alliance of a regional nation with the enemy that shifts the balance of power, even though an earlier assumption was that this alliance would not occur. Reframing indicators support the commander's ability to understand, learn, adapt, and reframe as necessary. Examples of such information include-\\n\\n- · Changes in the original problem statement.\\n- · Significant changes in threat composition.\\n- · Significant changes in the threat's approach.\\n- · Significant changes in friendly capability.\\n- · Higher echelon headquarters' policy changes or directives that change the desired end state.\\n- · Unexpected lack of friendly progress toward objectives.\\n- · Shifts in international support or domestic will.\\n- · Key assumptions prove to be invalid.\\n\\n## ASSESSMENT PLAN\\n\\n4-99. The assessment plan incorporates reframing criteria in the form of measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs) that are used to evaluate completed tasks, achieved objectives, and obtained end-state conditions. An effective assessment plan incorporates the logic used to build the plan. The logic as to why the commander believes the actions in the plan will produce the desired results is an important consideration when developing the assessment plan. Recording and understanding this logic during ADM helps the staff recommend the appropriate indicators for assessing the operation. It also helps the commander and staff determine if they need to reframe the problem if assumptions prove false or the logic behind the plan appears flawed as operations progress. (See Chapter 8 for details on building an assessment plan.)\\n\\n## Chapter 5\\n\\n## The Military Decision-Making Process\\n\\nThis chapter defines and describes the military decision-making process (MDMP). It provides an overview of the process followed by a detailed explanation for conducting each step of the MDMP. The chapter concludes with techniques for modifying the MDMP in a time-constrained</td>\n",

The initial assessment also helps determine when to begin certain actions to ensure forces are ready and in position before execution. This may require the commander to direct subordinates to start necessary movements, conduct task organization changes, begin information collection, and execute other preparation activities before completing the plan.\\n\\n- 5-21. Commanders and staffs allocate available planning time to prioritize different steps of the MDMP based on the given situation. For example, when conducting initial planning for a new operation, more time may be allocated to mission analysis than the other steps to develop a better understanding of the problem and OE. Time allocations will vary based on a variety of factors such as experience of the planning staff, products already available, and commander involvement. Table 5-1 depicts an example planning time allocation.\\n\\nTable 5-1. Planning time allocation\\n\\nNote. The initial time allocation is made during Step 1 to guide initial planning efforts. The commander and staff continue to adjust it as they gain a better understanding of time available during the following steps of the MDMP.\\n\\n5-22. Commanders and staffs balance a desire for detailed planning against a need for more immediate action. Time, more than any other factor, determines the detail to which the commander and staff can plan. The commander provides guidance to subordinate units as early as possible to allow subordinates the maximum time for their own planning and preparation of operations. As a rule, commanders allocate a minimum of two-thirds  of  available  time  for  subordinate  units  to  conduct  their  planning  and  preparation.  This  leaves one-third of the time for commanders and their staffs to do their planning and publish an order. They use the other  two-thirds  for  their  own  preparation.

In addition to planning, problem solving includes implementing the planned solution (execution), learning from the implementation of the solution (assessment), and modifying or developing a new solution as required. The object of problem solving is not just to solve near-term problems, but to do so in a way that forms the basis for long-term success. (See Chapter 3 on Army problem solving.)\\n\\n## IDENTIFY, MITIGATE, AND ACCEPT RISK\\n\\n- 1-29. Risk-the  exposure  of  someone  or  something  valued  to  danger,  harm,  or  loss-is  inherent  in  all operations. Because risk is part of all military operations, it cannot be avoided. Risk may range for resource shortfall or a course of actions that exposed a friendly force's flank. Identifying, mitigating, and accepting risk is a function of command and a key consideration during planning.\\n- 1-30. During  planning,  commanders  and  staffs  analyze  risk  in  collaboration  with  subordinates  and  their higher-level headquarters to help determine what level of risk exists and how to mitigate it. When considering how much risk to accept with a course of action, commanders consider risk to the force and risk to the mission against the perceived benefit. They apply judgment with regards to the importance of an objective, time available, and anticipated cost. Commanders balance the tension between protecting the force and accepting and managing risks that must be taken to accomplish their mission. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of risk as an element of operational art.)\\n\\n## DIRECT, COORDINATE, AND SYNCHRONIZE ACTIONS\\n\\n- 1-31. Plans  and  orders  are  the  principal  means  commanders  use  to  direct,  coordinate,  and  synchronize actions. They also inform those outside the unit how to cooperate and provide support. Effective plans and orders direct subordinates by stating what is required (the task) and why (the purpose). They leave much of the how (the method) up to subordinates.\\n- 1-32. Plans and orders contain control measures to coordinate and synchronize action. A control measure is a means of regulating forces or warfighting functions (ADP 6-0). Control measures aid in coordinating forces without imposing needless restrictions on their  freedom  of  action.  Commanders  use</td>\n",

This is vital to develop an effective operational approach to solve or manage identified problems. Here is an example of an initial problem statement based on the Freeland scenario.\\n\\nProblem statement: Aggressland forces are escalating their offensive activities against Freeland to destabilize the democratic government in Freeland and expand their regional hegemony. For more than fifty years, Freeland has maintained diplomatic, information, military, and economic autonomy. Other regional nations and world democracies have provided limited diplomatic and military support to Freeland, but these efforts have been insufficient to deter border incursions from Aggressland. Freeland is a diplomatic and economic partner to the U.S., but military partnership has been limited due to potentially negative international policy impacts. Freeland's military and civil defense forces are limited in size but are relatively modern. Aggressland has maintained a long-standing strategic rivalry with the U.S. To maintain deterrence and regional access, prevent crisis in Freeland, and bolster regional stability, the U.S. must be prepared for armed conflict in support of the defense of Freeland.\\n\\n- 4-63. Commanders and planners continue to develop the problem narrative as they learn more about an OE and develop an operational approach. For example, the small size of the Freeland defense force is a significant issue,  but  not  the  only  one.  After  discussing  the  problem  narrative  with  the  commander  and  others,  the planning team may expand the narrative by including problems associated with-\\n- · Availability of potential ports or intermediate staging locations for military forces.\\n- · Potential for special purpose attacks against regional partners, forward deployed military forces, or sustainment nodes.\\n- · Reinforcement of Freeland armed forces.\\n- · Influence of the adversary on other regional neighbors of Freeland.\\n- · Established adversary anti-access and area denial capabilities surrounding Freeland.\\n\\n## DEVELOP AN OPERATIONAL APPROACH\\n\\n4-64. Once commanders and planners agree on the problem or set of problems, they develop ways to address them. They do this by developing an operational approach-a description of the broad actions the force must take  to  transform  current  conditions  into  those  desired  at  end  state.

       "      <td>the most important aspect of mission analysis is determining the combat power of one's own force. Leaders understand the status of their Soldiers' morale, their experience and training, and the strengths and weaknesses of subordinate leaders. They determine all available resources and assess their capabilities. This  includes  troops  attached  to,  or  in  direct  support  of,  the  unit.  The  assessment  includes  knowing  the strength and status of unit equipment. It also includes understanding the full array of assets in support of the unit.  Leaders  know,  for  example,  how  much  indirect  fire,  space,  cyberspace,  or  information  operation capabilities will become available, when they are available, and they will know the best assets to inform planning. Leaders should consider any new limitations based on the level of training or recent operations.\\n\\n## TIME AVAILABLE\\n\\nA-26. Leaders not only appreciate how much time is available, but they also understand the time and space aspects  of  preparing,  moving,  fighting,  and  sustaining.  They  view  their  own  tasks  and  enemy  actions  in relation to time. They know how long it takes under different conditions to prepare for certain tasks (such as orders production, rehearsals, and subordinate element preparations). Leaders should remain mindful of the extended  timelines  generally  associated  with  achieving  information  effects  such  as  achieving  cognitive effects on enemy forces or creating and executing desired offensive cyberspace effects.
